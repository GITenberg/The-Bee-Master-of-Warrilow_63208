5</span>DEDICATION</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">TO THE
BEE-MASTER OF WARRILOW&rsquo;S</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">OLDEST AND
STAUNCHEST FRIEND,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">T. W. LITTLETON HAY</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THIS BOOK IS
AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">BY THE
WRITER</span></p>
<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>PREFACE
TO NEW EDITION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> original &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Bee-Master of Warrilow</span>&rdquo;&mdash;that
queer little honey-coloured book of far-off days&mdash;contained
but eleven chapters: in its present edition the book has grown to
more than three times its former length, and constitutes
practically a new volume.</p>
<p>To those who knew and loved the old &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Bee-Master of Warrilow</span>,&rdquo; no apology
for the additional chapters will be required, because it is
directly to the solicitation of many of them that this larger
collection of essays on English bee-garden life owes its
appearance.&nbsp; And equally, to those who will make the old
bee-man&rsquo;s acquaintance for the first time in these present
pages, little need be said.&nbsp; In spite of the War, the
honey-bee remains the same mysterious, fascinating creature that
she has ever been; and the men who live by the fruit of her toil
share with her the like changeless quality.&nbsp; The Master of
Warrilow and his bees can very well be left to win their own way
into the hearts of new readers as they did with the old.</p>

13</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the beautiful things of the
countryside, which are slowly but surely passing away, must be
reckoned the old Bee Gardens&mdash;fragrant, sunny nooks of
blossom, where the bees are housed only in the ancient straw
skeps, and have their own way in everything, the work of the
bee-keeper being little more than a placid looking-on at events
of which it would have been heresy to doubt the finite
perfection.</p>
<p>To say, however, that modern ideas of progress in bee-farming
must inevitably rob the pursuit of all its old-world poetry and
picturesqueness, would be to represent the case in an
unnecessarily bad light.&nbsp; The latter-day beehive, it is
true, has little more &aelig;sthetic value than a Brighton
bathing-machine; and the new class of bee-keepers, which is
springing up all over the country, is composed mainly of people
who have taken to the calling as they would to any other
lucrative business, having, for the most part, nothing but a
good-humoured contempt alike for the old-fashioned bee-keeper and
the ancient traditions and superstitions of his craft.</p>
<p>Nor can the inveterate, old-time skeppist himself&mdash;the
man who obstinately shuts his eyes to all that is good and true
in modern bee-science&mdash;be counted <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>on to help in the preservation of the
beautiful old gardens, or in keeping alive customs which have
been handed down from generation to generation, almost unaltered,
for literally thousands of years.&nbsp; Here and there, in the
remoter parts of the country, men can still be found who keep
their bees much in the same way as bees were kept in the time of
Columella or Virgil; and are content with as little profit.&nbsp;
But these form a rapidly diminishing class.&nbsp; The advantages
of modern methods are too overwhelmingly apparent.&nbsp; The old
school must choose between the adoption of latter-day systems, or
suffer the only alternative&mdash;that of total extinction at no
very distant date.</p>
<p>Luckily for English bee-keeping, there is a third class upon
which the hopes of all who love the ancient ways and days, and
yet recognise the absorbing interest and value of modern research
in apiarian science, may legitimately rely.&nbsp; Born and bred
amongst the hives, and steeped from their earliest years in the
lore of their skeppist forefathers, these interesting folk seem,
nevertheless, imbued to the core with the very spirit of
progress.&nbsp; While retaining an unlimited affection for all
the quaint old methods in bee-keeping, they maintain themselves,
unostentatiously, but very thoroughly, abreast of the
times.&nbsp; Nothing new is talked of in the world of bees that
these people do not make trial of, and quietly adopt into their
daily practice, if really serviceable; or as quietly discard, if
the contrivance prove to have little else than novelty to
recommend it.</p>
<p>As a rule, they are reserved, silent men, difficult of
approach; and yet, when once on terms of <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>familiarity,
they make the most charming of companions.&nbsp; Then they are
ever ready to talk about their bees, or discuss the latest
improvements in apiculture; to explain the intricacies of
bee-life, as revealed by the foremost modern observers, or to
dilate by the hour on the astounding delusions of medi&aelig;val
times.&nbsp; But they all seem to possess one invariable
characteristic&mdash;that of whole-hearted reverence for the
customs of their immediate ancestors, their own fathers and
grandfathers.&nbsp; In a long acquaintance with bee-men of this
class, I have never yet met with one who could be trapped into
any decided admission of defect in the old methods,
which&mdash;to say truth&mdash;were often as senseless as they
were futile, even when not directly contrary to the interest of
the bee-owner, or the plain, obvious dictates of humanity.&nbsp;
In this they form a refreshing contrast to the ultra-modern,
pushing young apiculturist of to-day; and it is as a type of this
class that the Bee-Master of Warrilow is presented to the
reader.</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHAPTER I<br />
THE BEE-MASTER OF WARRILOW</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Long</span>, lithe, and sinewy, with three
score years of sunburn on his keen, gnarled face, and the sure
stride of a mountain goat, the Bee-Master of Warrilow struck you
at once as a notable figure in any company.</p>
<p>Warrilow is a little precipitous village tucked away under the
green brink of the Sussex Downs; and the bee-farm lay on the
southern slope of the hill, with a sheltering barrier of pine
above, in which, all day long, the winter wind kept up an
impotent complaining.&nbsp; But below, among the hives, nothing
stirred in the frosty, sun-riddled air.&nbsp; Now and again a
solitary worker-bee darted up from a hive door, took a brisk turn
or two in the dazzling light, then hurried home again to the warm
cluster.&nbsp; But the flash and quiver of wings, and the drowsy
song of summer days, were gone in the iron-bound January weather;
and the bee-master was lounging idly to and fro in the great
main-way of the waxen <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>city, shot-gun under arm, and with
apparently nothing more to do than to meditate over past
achievements, or to plan out operations for the season to
come.</p>
<p>As I approached, the sharp report of the gun rang out, and a
little cloud of birds went chippering fearsomely away over the
hedgerow.&nbsp; The old man watched them as they flew off dark
against the snowy hillside.&nbsp; He threw out the
cartridge-cases disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue-tits!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are the
great pest of the bee-keeper in winter time.&nbsp; When the snow
covers the ground, and the frost has driven all insect-life deep
into the crevices of the trees, all the blue-caps for miles round
trek to the bee-gardens.&nbsp; Of course, if the bees would only
keep indoors they would be safe enough.&nbsp; But the same cause
that drives the birds in lures the bees out.&nbsp; The snow
reflects the sunlight up through the hive-entrances, and they
think the bright days of spring have come, and out they flock to
their death.&nbsp; And winter is just the time when every single
bee is valuable.&nbsp; In summer a few hundreds more or less make
little difference, when in every hive young bees are maturing at
the rate of several thousands a day to take the place of those
that perish.&nbsp; But now every bee captured by the tits is an
appreciable loss to the colony.&nbsp; They are all nurse-bees in
the winter-hives, and on them depends the safe hatching-out of
the first broods in the spring season.&nbsp; So the bee-keeper
would do well to include a shot-gun among his paraphernalia,
unless he is willing to feed all the starving tits of the
countryside at the risk of his year&rsquo;s harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;But the blue-cap,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is
not always content to wait for his breakfast until the bees
voluntarily bring it to him.&nbsp; He has a trick of enticing
them out of the hive which is often successful even in the
coldest weather.&nbsp; Come into the extracting-house yonder, and
I may be able to show you what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to a row of outbuildings which flanked the
northern boundary of the garden and formed additional shelter
from the blustering gale.&nbsp; A window of the extracting-house
overlooked the whole extent of hives.&nbsp; Opening this from
within with as little noise as possible, the bee-master put a
strong field-glass into my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we are out of sight,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;the tits will soon be back again.&nbsp; There they
come&mdash;whole families of them together!&nbsp; Now watch that
green hive over there under the apple-tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking through the glass, I saw that about a dozen tits had
settled in the tree.&nbsp; Their bright plumage contrasted
vividly with the sober green and grey of the lichened boughs, as
they swung themselves to and fro in the sunshine.&nbsp; But
presently the boldest of them gave up this pretence of searching
for food among the branches, and hopped down upon the
alighting-board of the hive.&nbsp; At once two or three others
followed him; and then began an ingenious piece of
business.&nbsp; The little company fell to pecking at the hard
wood with their bills, striking out a sharp ringing tattoo
plainly audible even where we lay hidden.&nbsp; The old bee-man
snorted contemptuously, and the cartridges slid home into the
breech of his gun with a vicious snap.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>&ldquo;Now keep an eye on the hive-entrance,&rdquo; he
said grimly.</p>
<p>The glass was a good one.&nbsp; Now I could plainly make out a
movement in this direction.&nbsp; The noise and vibration made by
the birds outside had roused the slumbering colony to a sense of
danger.&nbsp; About a dozen bees ran out to see what it all
meant, and were immediately pounced upon.&nbsp; And then the gun
spoke over my head.&nbsp; It was a shot into the air, but it
served its harmless purpose.&nbsp; From every bush and tree there
came over to us a dull whirr of wings like far-off thunder, as
the blue marauders sped away for the open country, filling the
air with their frightened jingling note.</p>
<p>Perhaps of all cosy retreats from the winter blast it has ever
been my good fortune to discover, the extracting-room on Warrilow
bee-farm was the brightest and most comfortable.&nbsp; In
summer-time the whole life of the apiary centred here; and the
stress and bustle, inevitable during the season of the great
honey-flow, obscured its manifold possibilities.&nbsp; But in
winter the extracting-machines were, for the most part, silent;
and the natural serenity and cosiness of the place reasserted
themselves triumphantly.&nbsp; From the open furnace-door a ruddy
warmth and glow enriched every nook and corner of the long
building.&nbsp; The walls were lined with shelves where the
polished tin vessels, in which the surplus honey was stored, gave
back the fire-shine in a hundred flickering points of amber
light.&nbsp; The work of hive-making in the neighbouring sheds
was going briskly forward, but the noise of hammering, the shrill
hum of sawing and planing <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>machinery, and the intermittent cough
of the oil-engine reached us only as a subdued, tranquil
murmur&mdash;the very voice of rest.</p>
<p>The bee-master closed the window behind its thick bee-proof
curtains, and, putting his gun away in a corner, drew a
comfortable high-backed settle near to the cheery blaze.&nbsp;
Then he disappeared for a moment, and returned with a dusty
cobweb-shrouded bottle, which he carried in a wicker cradle as a
butler would bear priceless old wine.&nbsp; The cork came out
with a ringing jubilant report, and the pale, straw-coloured
liquid foamed into the glasses like champagne.&nbsp; It stilled
at once, leaving the whole inner surface of the glass veneered
with golden bells.&nbsp; The old bee-man held it up critically
against the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last of 19&ndash;,&rdquo; he said,
regretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;The finest mead year in this part of
the country for many a decade back.&nbsp; Most people have never
tasted the old Anglo-Saxon drink that King Alfred loved, and
probably Harold&rsquo;s men made merry with on the eve of
Hastings.&nbsp; So they can&rsquo;t be expected to know that
metheglin varies with each season as much as wine from the
grape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the goodness of the liquor there admitted no
question.&nbsp; It had the bouquet of a ripe Ribston pippin, and
the potency of East Indian sherry thrice round the Horn.&nbsp;
But its flavour entirely eluded all attempt at comparison.&nbsp;
There was a suggestive note of fine old perry about it, and a dim
reminder of certain almost colourless Rhenish wines, never
imported, and only to be encountered in moments of rare and happy
chance.&nbsp; Yet neither of these parallels came within a
sunbeam&rsquo;s length of <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the truth about this immaculate
honey-vintage of Warrilow.&nbsp; Pondering over the liquor thus,
the thought came to me that nothing less than a supreme occasion
could have warranted its production to-day.&nbsp; And this
conjecture was immediately verified.&nbsp; The bee-master raised
his glass above his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Bees of Warrilow!&rdquo; he said, lapsing into
the broad Sussex dialect, as he always did when much moved by his
theme.&nbsp; &ldquo;Forty-one years ago to-day the first stock I
ever owned was fixed up out there under the old codlin-tree; and
now there are two hundred and twenty of them.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
before you were born, likely as not; and bee science has seen
many changes since then.&nbsp; In those days there were nothing
but the old straw skeps, and most bee-keepers knew as little
about the inner life of their bees as we do of the bottom of the
South Pacific.&nbsp; Now things are very different; but the
improvement is mostly in the bee-keepers themselves.&nbsp; The
bees are exactly as they always have been, and work on the same
principles as they did in the time of Solomon.&nbsp; They go
their appointed way inexorably, and all the bee-master can do is
to run on ahead and smooth the path a little for them.&nbsp;
Indeed, after forty odd years of bee-keeping, I doubt if the bees
even realise that they are &lsquo;kept&rsquo; at all.&nbsp; The
bee-master&rsquo;s work has little more to do with their progress
than the organ-blower&rsquo;s with the tune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you,&rdquo; I asked him, as we parted, &ldquo;after
all these years of experience, lay down for beginners in
beemanship one royal maxim of success above any other?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>He
thought it over a little, the gun on his shoulder again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they might take warning from this same King
Solomon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and beware the foreign feminine
element.&nbsp; Let British bee-keepers cease to import queen bees
from Italy and elsewhere, and stick to the good old English
Black.&nbsp; All my bees are of this strain, and mostly from one
pure original Sussex stock.&nbsp; The English black bee is a more
generous honey-maker in indifferent seasons; she does not swarm
so determinedly, under proper treatment, as the Ligurians or
Carniolans; and, above all, though she is not so handsome as some
of her Continental rivals, she comes of a hardy northern race,
and stands the ups and downs of the British winter better than
any of the fantastic yellow-girdled crew from
overseas.&rdquo;</p>

FEBRUARY AMONGST THE HIVES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> midday sun shone warm from a
cloudless sky.&nbsp; Up in the highest elm-tops the south-west
wind kept the chattering starlings gently swinging, but below in
the bee-garden scarce a breath moved under the rich soft
light.</p>
<p>As I lifted the latch of the garden-gate, the sharp click
brought a stooping figure erect in the midst of the hives; and
the bee-master came down the red-tiled winding path to meet
me.&nbsp; He carried a box full of some yellowish powdery
substance in one hand, and a big pitcher of water in the other;
and as usual, his shirt-sleeves were tucked up to the shoulder,
baring his weather-browned arms to the morning sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we begin the year&rsquo;s bee-work?&rdquo; he
said, repeating my question amusedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, we began
on New Year&rsquo;s morning.&nbsp; And last year&rsquo;s work was
finished on Old Year&rsquo;s night.&nbsp; If you go with the
times, every day in the year has its work on a modern bee-farm,
either indoors or out.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is on these first warm days of spring,&rdquo; he
continued, as I followed him into the thick of the hives,
&ldquo;that outdoor work for the bee-man starts in earnest.&nbsp;
The bees began long ago.&nbsp; <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>January was not out before the first
few eggs were laid right in the centre of the brood-combs.&nbsp;
And from now on, if only we manage properly, each bee-colony will
go on increasing until, in the height of the season, every queen
will be laying from two thousand to three thousand eggs a
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and set down his box and his pitcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we manage properly.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s the
rub.&nbsp; Success in bee-keeping is all a question of
numbers.&nbsp; The more worker-bees there are when the honey-flow
begins, the greater will be the honey-harvest.&nbsp; The whole
art of the bee-keeper consists in maintaining a steady increase
in population from the first moment the queens begin to lay in
January, until the end of May brings on the rush of the white
clover, and every bee goes mad with work from morning to
night.&nbsp; Of course, in countries where the climate is
reasonable, and the year may be counted on to warm up steadily
month by month, all this is fairly easy; but with topsy-turvy
weather, such as we get in England, it is a vastly different
matter.&nbsp; Just listen to the bees now!&nbsp; And this is only
February!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep vibrating murmur was upon the air.&nbsp; It came from
all sides of us; it rose from under foot, where the crocuses were
blooming; it seemed to fill the blue sky above with an ocean of
sweet sound.&nbsp; The sunlight was alive with scintillating
points of light, like cast handfuls of diamonds, as the bees
darted hither and thither, or hovered in little joyous companies
round every hive.&nbsp; They swept to and fro between us;
gambolled about our heads; came with a sudden shrill menacing
note and scrutinised our mouths, our ears, our eyes, or <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>settled on
our hands and faces, comfortably, and with no apparent haste to
be gone.&nbsp; The bee-master noted my growing uneasiness, not to
say trepidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is only their companionableness.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t
sting&mdash;at least, not if you give them their way.&nbsp; But
now come and see what we are doing to help on the queens in their
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At different stations in the garden I had noticed some shallow
wooden trays standing among the hives.&nbsp; The old bee-man led
the way to one of these.&nbsp; Here the humming was louder and
busier than ever.&nbsp; The tray was full of fine wood-shavings,
dusted over with the yellow powder from the bee-master&rsquo;s
box; and scores of bees were at work in it, smothering themselves
from head to foot, and flying off like golden millers to the
hives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is pea-flour,&rdquo; explained the master,
&ldquo;and it takes the place of pollen as food for the young
bees, until the spring flowers open and the natural supply is
available.&nbsp; This forms the first step in the
bee-keeper&rsquo;s work of patching up the defective English
climate.&nbsp; From the beginning our policy is to deceive the
queens into the belief that all is prosperity and progress
outside.&nbsp; We keep all the hives well covered up, and
contract the entrances, so that a high temperature is maintained
within, and the queens imagine summer is already advancing.&nbsp;
Then they see the pea-flour coming in plentifully, and conclude
that the fields and hillsides are covered with flowers; for they
never come out of the hives except at swarming-time, and must
judge of the year by what they see around them.&nbsp; Then in a
week or two we shall put the <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>spring-feeders on, and give each hive
as much syrup as the bees can take down; and this, again, leads
the queens into the belief that the year&rsquo;s food-supply has
begun in earnest.&nbsp; The result is that the winter lethargy in
the hive is soon completely overthrown, the queens begin to lay
unrestrictedly, and the whole colony is forging on towards summer
strength long before there is any natural reason for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were stooping down, watching the bees at the nearest
hive.&nbsp; A little cloud of them was hovering in the sunshine,
heads towards the entrance, keeping up a shrill jovial contented
note as they flew.&nbsp; Others were roving round with a vagrant,
workless air, singing a low desultory song as they trifled about
among the crocuses, passing from gleaming white to rich purple,
then to gold, and back again to white, just as the mood took
them.&nbsp; In the hive itself there was evidently a kind of
spring-cleaning well in progress.&nbsp; Hundreds of the bees were
bringing out minute sand-coloured particles, which accumulated on
the alighting-board visibly as we watched.&nbsp; Now and again a
worker came backing out, dragging a dead bee laboriously after
her.&nbsp; Instantly two or three others rushed to help in the
task, and between them they tumbled the carcass over the edge of
the footboard down among the grass below.&nbsp; Sometimes the
burden was of a pure white colour, like the ghost of a bee,
perfect in shape, with beady black eyes, and its colourless wings
folded round it like a cerecloth.&nbsp; Then it seemed to be less
weighty, and its carrier usually shouldered the gruesome thing,
and flew away with it high up into the sunshine, and swiftly out
of view.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>&ldquo;Those are the undertakers,&rdquo; said the
bee-master, ruminatively filling a pipe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Their work
is to carry the dead out of the hive.&nbsp; That last was one of
the New Year&rsquo;s brood, and they often die in the cell like
that, especially at the beginning of the season.&nbsp; All that
fine drift is the cell-cappings thrown down during the winter
from time to time as the stores were broached, and every warm day
sees them cleaning up the hive in this way.&nbsp; And now watch
these others&mdash;these that are coming and going straight in
and out of the hive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed the pointing pipe-stem.&nbsp; The alighting-stage
was covered with a throng of bees, each busily intent on some
particular task.&nbsp; But every now and then a bee emerged from
the hive with a rush, elbowed her way excitedly through the
crowd, and darted straight off into the sunshine without an
instant&rsquo;s pause.&nbsp; In the same way others were
returning, and as swiftly disappearing into the hive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the water-carriers,&rdquo; explained the
master.&nbsp; &ldquo;Water is a constant need in bee-life almost
the whole year round.&nbsp; It is used to soften the mixture of
honey and pollen with which the young grubs and newly-hatched
bees are fed; and the old bees require a lot of it to dilute
their winter stores.&nbsp; The river is the traditional
watering-place for my bees here, and in the summer it serves very
well; but in the winter hundreds are lost either through cold or
drowning.&nbsp; And so at this time we give them a water-supply
close at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his pitcher, and led the way to the other end of
the garden.&nbsp; Here, on a bench, he showed me a long row of
glass jars full of water, standing mouth downward, each on its
separate <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>plate of blue china.&nbsp; The water was oozing out
round the edges of the jars, and scores of the bees were drinking
at it side by side, like cattle at a trough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We give it them lukewarm,&rdquo; said the old bee-man,
&ldquo;and always mix salt with it.&nbsp; If we had sea-water
here, nothing would be better; seaside bees often go down to the
shore to drink, as you may prove for yourself on any fine day in
summer.&nbsp; Why are all the plates blue?&nbsp; Bees are as
fanciful in their ways as our own women-folk, and in nothing more
than on the question of colour.&nbsp; Just this particular shade
of light blue seems to attract them more than any other.&nbsp;
Next to that, pure white is a favourite with them; but they have
a pronounced dislike to anything brilliantly red, as all the old
writers about bees noticed hundreds of years ago.&nbsp; If I were
to put some of the drinking-jars on bright red saucers now, you
would not see half as many bees on them as on the pale
blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We moved on to the extracting-house, whence the master now
fetched his smoker, and a curious knife, with a broad and very
keen-looking blade.&nbsp; He packed the tin nozzle of the smoker
with rolled brown paper, lighted it, and, by means of the little
bellows underneath, soon blew it up into full strength.&nbsp;
Then he went to one of the quietest hives, where only a few bees
were wandering aimlessly about, and sent a dense stream of smoke
into the entrance.&nbsp; A moment later he had taken the roof and
coverings off, and was lifting out the central comb-frames one by
one, with the bees clinging in thousands all about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have come to what is <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>really the
most important operation of all in the bee-keeper&rsquo;s work of
stimulating his stocks for the coming season.&nbsp; Here in the
centre of each comb you see the young brood; but all the cells
above and around it are full of honey, still sealed over and
untouched by the bees.&nbsp; The stock is behind time.&nbsp; The
queen must be roused at once to her responsibilities, and here is
one very simple and effective way of doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the knife, deftly shaved off the cappings from the
honey-cells of each comb, and as quickly returned the frames,
dripping with honey, to the brood-nest.&nbsp; In a few seconds
the hive was comfortably packed down again, and he was looking
round for the next languid stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these slow, backward colonies,&rdquo; said the
bee-master, as he puffed away with his smoker, &ldquo;will have
to be treated after the same fashion.&nbsp; The work must be
smartly done, or you will chill the brood; but, in uncapping the
stores like this, right in the centre of the brood-nest, the
effect on the stock is magical.&nbsp; The whole hive reeks with
the smell of honey, and such evidence of prosperity is
irresistible.&nbsp; To-morrow, if you come this way, you will see
all these timorous bee-folk as busy as any in the
garden.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>CHAPTER III<br />
A TWENTIETH CENTURY BEE-FARMER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was sunny spring in the
bee-garden.&nbsp; The thick elder-hedge to the north was full of
young green leaf; everywhere the trim footways between the hives
were marked by yellow bands of crocus-bloom, and daffodils just
showing a golden promise of what they would be in a few warm days
to come.&nbsp; From a distance I had caught the fresh spring song
of the hives, and had seen the bee-master and his men at work in
different quarters of the mimic city.&nbsp; But now, drawing
nearer, I observed they were intent on what seemed to me a
perfectly astounding enterprise.&nbsp; Each man held a spoon in
one hand and a bowl of what I now knew to be pea-flour in the
other, and I saw that they were busily engaged in filling the
crocus-blossoms up to the brim with this inestimable
condiment.&nbsp; My friend the bee-master looked up on my
approach, and, as was his wont, forestalled the inevitable
questioning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is another way of giving it,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and the best of all in the earliest part of the
season.&nbsp; Instinct leads the bees to the flowers for
pollen-food when they will not look for it <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>elsewhere;
and as the natural supply is very meagre, we just help them in
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke I became rather unpleasantly aware of a change of
manners on the part of his winged people.&nbsp; First one and
then another came harping round, and, settling comfortably on my
face, showed no inclination to move again.&nbsp; In my ignorance
I was for brushing them off, but the bee-master came hurriedly to
my rescue.&nbsp; He dislodged them with a few gentle puffs from
his tobacco-pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is always their way in the spring-time,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;The warmth of the skin attracts them, and
the best thing to do is to take no notice.&nbsp; If you had
knocked them off you would probably have been stung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true that a bee can only sting once?&rdquo; I
asked him, as he bent again over the crocus beds.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the good of a sword to a soldier,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;if only one blow could be struck with it?&nbsp;
It is certainly true that the bee does not usually sting a second
time, but that is only because you are too hasty with her.&nbsp;
You brush her off before she has had time to complete her
business, and the barbed sting, holding in the wound, is torn
away, and the bee dies.&nbsp; But now watch how the thing works
naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bee had settled on his hand as he was speaking.&nbsp; He
closed his fingers gently over it, and forced it to sting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, quite unconcernedly,
&ldquo;look what really happens.&nbsp; The bee makes two or three
lunges before she gets the sting fairly <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>home.&nbsp;
Then the poison is injected.&nbsp; Now watch what she does
afterwards.&nbsp; See! she has finished her work, and is turning
round and round!&nbsp; The barbs are arranged spirally on the
sting, and she is twisting it out corkscrew-fashion.&nbsp; Now
she is free again! there she goes, you see, weapon and all; and
ready to sting again if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crocus-filling operation was over now, and the bee-master
took up his barrow and led the way to a row of hives in the
sunniest part of the garden.&nbsp; He pulled up before the first
of the hives, and lighted his smoking apparatus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; he said, as he fell to work, &ldquo;have
not been opened since October, and it is high time we saw how
things are going with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drove a few strong puffs of smoke into the entrance of the
hive and removed the lid.&nbsp; Three or four thicknesses of warm
woollen quilting lay beneath.&nbsp; Under these a square of linen
covered the tops of the frames, to which it had been firmly
propolised by the bees.&nbsp; My friend began to peel this
carefully off, beginning at one corner and using the smoker
freely as the linen ripped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a full-weight hive in the autumn,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;so there was no need for candy-feeding.&nbsp; But
they most be pretty near the end of their stores now.&nbsp; You
see how they are all together on the three or four frames in the
centre of the hive?&nbsp; The other combs are quite empty and
deserted.&nbsp; And look how near they are clustering to the top
of the bars!&nbsp; Bees always feed upwards, and that means we
must begin spring-feeding right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the barrow, on which was a large <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>box, lined
with warm material, and containing bar frames full of sealed
honeycomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are extra combs from last summer.&nbsp; I keep
them in a warm cupboard over the stove at about the same
temperature as the hive we are going to put them into.&nbsp; But
first they must be uncapped.&nbsp; Have you ever seen the Bingham
used?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the inexhaustible barrow he produced the long knife with
the broad, flat blade; and, poising the frame of honeycomb
vertically on his knee, he removed the sheet of cell-caps with
one dexterous cut, laying the honey bare from end to end.&nbsp;
This frame was then lowered into the hive with the uncapped side
close against the clustering bees.&nbsp; Another comb, similarly
treated, was placed on the opposite flank of the cluster.&nbsp;
Outside each of these a second full comb was as swiftly brought
into position.&nbsp; Then the sliding inner walls of the
brood-nest were pushed up close to the frame, and the quilts and
roof restored.&nbsp; The whole seemed the work of a few moments
at the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this early spring work,&rdquo; said the bee-master,
as we moved to the next hive, &ldquo;is based upon the
recognition of one thing.&nbsp; In the south here the real great
honey-flow comes all at once: very often the main honey-harvest
for the year has to be won or lost during three short weeks of
summer.&nbsp; The bees know this, and from the first days of
spring they have only the one idea&mdash;to create an immense
population, so that when the honey-flow begins there may be no
lack of harvesters.&nbsp; But against this main idea there is
another one&mdash;their ingrained and invincible caution.&nbsp;
Not an egg will <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>be laid nor a grub hatched unless there is reasonable
chance of subsistence for it.&nbsp; The populace of the hive must
be increased only in proportion to the amount of stores coming
in.&nbsp; With a good spring, and the early honey plentiful, the
queen will increase her production of eggs with every day, and
the population of the hive will advance accordingly.&nbsp; But
if, on the very brink of the great honey-flow, there comes, as is
so often the case, a spell of cold windy weather, laying is
stopped at once; and, if the cold continues, all hatching grubs
are destroyed and the garrison put on half-rations.&nbsp; And so
the work of months is undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped to bring his friendly pipe to my succour again, for
a bee was trying to get down my collar in the most unnerving way,
and another had apparently mistaken my mouth for the front-door
of his hive.&nbsp; The intruders happily driven off, the master
went back to his work and his talk together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is just here that the art of the bee-keeper
comes in.&nbsp; He must prevent this interruption to progress by
maintaining the confidence of the bees in the season.&nbsp; He
must create an artificial plenty until the real prosperity
begins.&nbsp; Yet, after all, he must never lose sight of the
main principle, of carrying out the ideas of the bees, not his
own. In good beemanship there is only one road to success: you
must study to find out what the bees intend to do, and then help
them to do it.&nbsp; They call us bee-masters, but bee-servants
would be much the better name.&nbsp; The bees have their definite
plan of life, perfected through countless ages, and nothing you
can do will ever turn them from it.&nbsp; <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>You can delay
their work, or you can even thwart it altogether, but no one has
ever succeeded in changing a single principle in bee-life.&nbsp;
And so the best bee-master is always the one who most exactly
obeys the orders from the hive.&rdquo;</p>

37</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
CHLOE AMONG THE BEES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bee-mistress looked at my card,
then put its owner under a like careful scrutiny.&nbsp; In the
shady garden where we stood, the sunlight fell in quivering
golden splashes round our feet.&nbsp; High overhead, in the
purple elm-blossom, the bees and the glad March wind made rival
music.&nbsp; Higher still a ripple of lark-song hung in the blue,
and a score of rooks were sailing by, filling the morning with
their rich, deep clamour of unrest.</p>
<p>The bee-mistress drew off her sting-proof gloves in thoughtful
deliberation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I show you the bee-farm,&rdquo; said she, eyeing me
somewhat doubtfully, &ldquo;and let you see what women have done
and are doing in an ideal feminine industry, will you promise to
write of us with seriousness?&nbsp; I mean, will you undertake to
deal with the matter for what it is&mdash;a plain, business
enterprise by business people&mdash;and not treat it flippantly,
just because no masculine creature has had a hand in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an attempt,&rdquo; she went on&mdash;the
needful assurances having been given&mdash;&ldquo;an attempt,
and, we believe, a real solution to a very real difficulty.&nbsp;
There are thousands of educated women in the <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>towns who
have to earn their own bread; and they do it usually by trying to
compete with men in walks of life for which they are wholly
unsuited.&nbsp; Now, why do they not come out into the pure air
and quiet of the countryside, and take up any one of several
pursuits open there to a refined, well-bred woman?&nbsp;
Everywhere the labourers are forsaking the land and crowding into
the cities.&nbsp; That is a farmers&rsquo; problem, with which,
of course, women have nothing to do.&nbsp; The rough, heavy work
in the cornfields must always be done either by men or
machinery.&nbsp; But there are certain employments, even in the
country, that women can invariably undertake better than men, and
bee-keeping is one of them.&nbsp; The work is light.&nbsp; It
needs just that delicacy and deftness of touch that only a woman
can bring to it.&nbsp; It is profitable.&nbsp; Above all, there
is nothing about it, from first to last, of an objectionable
character, demanding masculine interference.&nbsp; In
poultry-farming, good as it is for women, there must always be a
stony-hearted man about the place to do unnameable necessary
things in a fluffy back-shed.&nbsp; But bee-keeping is clean,
clever, humanising, open-air work&mdash;essentially women&rsquo;s
work all through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had led the way through the scented old-fashioned garden,
towards a gate in the farther wall, talking as she went.&nbsp;
Now she paused, with her hand on the latch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we call the Transition
Gate.&nbsp; It divides our work from our play.&nbsp; On this side
of it we have the tennis-court and the croquet, and other games
that women love, young or old.&nbsp; But it is all serious
business on the other side.&nbsp; And <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>now you shall see our latter-day
Eden, with its one unimportant omission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the door swung back to her touch, the murmur that was upon
the air grew suddenly in force and volume.&nbsp; Looking through,
I saw an old orchard, spacious, sun-riddled, carpeted with green;
and, stretching away under the ancient apple-boughs, long, neat
rows of hives, a hundred or more, all alive with bees, winnowing
the March sunshine with their myriad wings.</p>
<p>Here and there in the shade-dappled pleasance figures were
moving about, busily at work among the hives, figures of women
clad in trim holland blouses, and wearing bee-veils, through
which only a dim guess at the face beneath could be
hazarded.&nbsp; Laughter and talk went to and fro in the
sun-steeped quiet of the place; and one of the fair bee-gardeners
near at hand&mdash;young and pretty, I could have sworn, although
her blue gauze veil disclosed provokingly little&mdash;was
singing to herself, as she stooped over an open hive, and lifted
the crowded brood-frames one by one up into the light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great work of the year is just beginning with
us,&rdquo; explained the bee-mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;In these
first warm days of spring every hive must be opened and its
condition ascertained.&nbsp; Those that are short of stores must
be fed; backward colonies must be quickened to a sense of their
responsibilities.&nbsp; Clean hives must be substituted for the
old, winter-soiled dwellings.&nbsp; Queens that are past their
prime will have to be dethroned, and their places filled by
younger and more vigorous successors.&nbsp; But it is all
typically women&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; You have an old <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>acquaintance
with the lordly bee-master and his ways; now come and see how a
woman manages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed over to the singing lady in the veil, and&mdash;from
a safe distance&mdash;watched her at her work.&nbsp; Each frame,
as it was raised out of the seething abyss of the hive, was
turned upside down and carefully examined.&nbsp; A little vortex
of bees swung round her head, shrilling vindictively.&nbsp; Those
on the uplifted comb-frames hustled to and fro like frightened
sheep, or crammed themselves head foremost into the empty cells,
out of reach of the disturbing light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a queenless stock,&rdquo; said the
bee-mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is going to be united with another
colony, where there is a young, high-mettled ruler in want of
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We watched the bee-gardener as she went to one of the
neighbouring hives, subdued and opened it, drew out all the
brood-combs, and brought them over in a carrying-rack, with the
bees clustering in thousands all about them.&nbsp; Then a
scent-diffuser was brought into play, and the fragrance of
lavender-water came over to us, as the combs of both hives were
quickly sprayed with the perfume, then lowered into the hive, a
frame from each stock alternately.&nbsp; It was the old
time-honoured plan for uniting bee-colonies, by impregnating them
with the same odour, and so inducing the bees to live together
peaceably, where otherwise a deadly war might ensue.&nbsp; But
the whole operation was carried through with a neat celerity, and
light, dexterous handling, I had never seen equalled by any
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl,&rdquo; said the bee-mistress, as we moved
away, &ldquo;came to me out of a London office a year <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>ago,
an&aelig;mic, pale as the paper she typed on all day for a
living.&nbsp; Now she is well and strong, and almost as brown as
the bees she works among so willingly.&nbsp; All my girls here
have come to me from time to time in the same way out of the
towns, forsaking indoor employment that was surely stunting all
growth of mind and body.&nbsp; And there are thousands who would
do the same to-morrow, if only the chance could be given
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stopped in the centre of the old orchard.&nbsp; Overhead
the swelling fruit-buds glistened against the blue sky.&nbsp;
Merry thrush-music rang out far and near.&nbsp; Sun and shadow,
the song of the bees, laughing voices, a snatch of an old Sussex
chantie, the perfume of violet-beds and nodding gillyflowers, all
came over to us through the lichened tree-stems, in a flood of
delicious colour and scent and sound.&nbsp; The bee-mistress
turned to me, triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would any sane woman,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;stop in
the din and dirt of a smoky city, if she could come and work in a
place like this?&nbsp; Bee-keeping for women! do you not see what
a chance it opens up to poor toiling folk, pining for fresh air
and sunshine, especially to the office-girl class, girls often of
birth and refinement&mdash;just that kind of poor gentlewomen
whose breeding and social station render them most difficult of
all to help?&nbsp; And here is work for them, clean,
intellectual, profitable; work that will keep them all day long
in the open air; a healthy, happy country life, humanly within
the reach of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is wanted,&rdquo; continued the bee-mistress, as
we went slowly down the broad main-way of the honey-farm,
&ldquo;is for some great lady, rich in <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>business ideas as well as in pocket,
to take up the whole scheme, and to start a network of small
bee-gardens for women over the whole land.&nbsp; Very large
bee-farms are a mistake, I think, except in the most favourable
districts.&nbsp; Bees work only within a radius of two or three
miles at most, so that the number of hives that can be kept
profitably in a given area has its definite limits.&nbsp; But
there is still plenty of room everywhere for bee-farms of
moderate size, conducted on the right principles; and there is no
reason at all why they should not work together on the
co-operative plan, sending all their produce to some convenient
centre in each district, to be prepared and marketed for the
common good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the whole outcome,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;of a
scheme like this depends on the business qualities imported into
it.&nbsp; Here, in the heart of the Sussex Weald, we labour
together in the midst of almost ideal surroundings, but we never
lose sight of the plain, commercial aspect of the thing.&nbsp; We
study all the latest writings on our subject, experiment with all
novelties, and keep ourselves well abreast of the times in every
way.&nbsp; Our system is to make each hive show a clear, definite
profit.&nbsp; The annual income is not, and can never be, a very
large one, but we fare quite simply, and have sufficient for our
needs.&nbsp; In any case, however, we have proved here that a few
women, renting a small house and garden out in the country, can
live together comfortably on the proceeds from their bees; and
there is no reason in the world why the idea should not be
carried out by others with equal success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had made the round of the whole busy, <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>murmuring
enclosure, and had come again to the little door in the
wall.&nbsp; Passing through and out once more into the world of
merely masculine endeavour, the bee-mistress gave me a final
word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may think,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that what I
advocate, though successful in our own single instance, might
prove impracticable on a widely extended scale.&nbsp; Well, do
you know that last year close upon three hundred and fifty tons
of honey were imported into Great Britain from foreign sources,
<a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43"
class="citation">[43]</a> just because our home apiculturists
were unable to cope with the national demand?&nbsp; And this
being so, is it too much to think that, if women would only band
themselves together and take up bee-keeping systematically, as we
have done, all or most of that honey could be produced&mdash;of
infinitely better quality&mdash;here, on our own British
soil?&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>CHAPTER V<br />
A BEE-MAN OF THE &rsquo;FORTIES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old bee-garden lay on the verge
of the wood.&nbsp; Seen from a distance it looked like a great
white china bowl brimming over with roses; but a nearer view
changed the porcelain to a snowy barrier of hawthorn, and the
roses became blossoming apple-boughs, stretching up into the May
sunshine, where all the bees in the world seemed to have
forgathered, filling the air with their rich wild chant.</p>
<p>Coming into the old garden from the glare of the dusty road,
the hives themselves were the last thing to rivet
attention.&nbsp; As you went up the shady moss-grown path,
perhaps the first impression you became gratefully conscious of
was the slow dim quiet of the place&mdash;a quiet that had in it
all the essentials of silence, and yet was really made up of a
myriad blended sounds.&nbsp; Then the sheer carmine of the
tulips, in the sunny vista beyond the orchard, came upon you like
a trumpet-note through the shadowy aisles of the trees; and after
this, in turn, the flaming amber of the marigolds, broad zones of
forget-me-nots like strips of the blue sky fallen, snow-drifts of
arabis and starwort, <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>purple pansy-spangles veering to
every breeze.&nbsp; And last of all you became gradually aware
that every bright nook or shade-dappled corner round you had its
nestling bee-skep, half hidden in the general riot of blossom,
yet marked by the steadier, deeper song of the homing bees.</p>
<p>To stand here, in the midst of the hives, of a fine May
morning, side by side with the old bee-man, and watch with him
for the earliest swarms of the year, was an experience that took
one back far into another and a kindlier century.&nbsp; There
were certain hives in the garden, grey with age and smothered in
moss and lichen, that were the traditional mother-colonies of all
the rest.&nbsp; The old bee-keeper treasured them as relics of
his sturdy manhood, just as he did the percussion fowling-piece
over his mantel; and pointed to one in particular as being close
on thirty years old.&nbsp; Nowadays remorseless science has
proved that the individual life of the honey-bee extends to four
or five months at most; but the old bee-keeper firmly believed
that some at least of the original members of this colony still
flourished in green old age deep in the sombre corridors of the
ancient skep.&nbsp; Bending down, he would point out to you,
among the crowd on the alighting-board, certain bees with
polished thorax and ragged wings worn almost to a stump.&nbsp;
While the young worker-bees were charging in and out of the hive
at breakneck speed, these superannuated amazons doddered about in
the sunlight, with an obvious and pathetic assumption of
importance.&nbsp; They were really the last survivors of the
bygone winter&rsquo;s brood.&nbsp; Their task of hatching the new
spring generation was <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>over; and now, the power of flight
denied to them, they busied themselves in the work of sentinels
at the gate, or in grooming the young bees as they came out for
their first adventure into the far world of blossoming clover
under the hill.</p>
<p>For modern apiculture, with its interchangeable comb-frames
and section-supers, and American notions generally, the old
bee-keeper harboured a fine contempt.&nbsp; In its place he had
an exhaustless store of original bee-knowledge, gathered
throughout his sixty odd years of placid life among the
bees.&nbsp; His were all old-fashioned hives of straw, hackled
and potsherded just as they must have been any time since Saxon
Alfred burned the cakes.&nbsp; Each bee-colony had its separate
three-legged stool, and each leg stood in an earthen pan of
water, impassable moat for ants and
&ldquo;wood-li&rsquo;s,&rdquo; and such small
honey-thieves.&nbsp; Why the hives were thus dotted about in such
admired but inconvenient disorder was a puzzle at first, until
you learned more of ancient bee-traditions.&nbsp; Wherever a
swarm settled&mdash;up in the pink-rosetted apple-boughs, under
the eaves of the old thatched cottage, or deep in the tangle of
the hawthorn hedge&mdash;there, on the nearest open ground
beneath, was its inalienable, predetermined home.&nbsp; When, as
sometimes happened, the swarm went straight away out of sight
over the meadows, or sailed off like a pirouetting grey cloud
over the roof of the wood, the old bee-keeper never sought to
reclaim it for the garden.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis gone to the shires fer change o&rsquo;
air,&rdquo; he would say, shielding his bleak blue eyes with his
hand, as he gazed after it.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twould be agen <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>natur&rsquo;
to hike &rsquo;em back here along.&nbsp; An&rsquo; naught but
ill-luck an&rsquo; worry wi&rsquo;out end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never observed the skies for tokens of to-morrow&rsquo;s
weather, as did his neighbours of the countryside.&nbsp; The bees
were his weather-glass and thermometer in one.&nbsp; If they
hived very early after noon, though the sun went down in clear
gold and the summer night loomed like molten amethyst under the
starshine, he would prophesy rain before morning.&nbsp; And sure
enough you were wakened at dawn by a furious patter on the
window, and the booming of the south-west wind in the pine-clad
crest of the hill.&nbsp; But if the bees loitered afield far into
the gusty crimson gloaming, and the loud darkness that followed
seemed only to bring added intensity to the busy labour-note
within the hives, no matter how the wind keened or the griddle of
black storm-cloud threatened, he would go on with his evening
task of watering his garden, sure of a morrow of cloudless heat
to come.</p>
<p>He knew all the sources of honey for miles around; and, by
taste and smell, could decide at once the particular crop from
which each sample had been gathered.&nbsp; He would discriminate
between that from white clover or sainfoin; the produce of the
yellow charlock wastes; or the orchard-honey, wherein it seemed
the fragrance of cherry-bloom was always to be differentiated
from that of apple or damson or pear.&nbsp; He would tell you
when good honey had been spoilt by the grosser flavour of
sunflower or horse-chestnut; or when the detestable honey-dew had
entered into its composition; or, the super-caps having been
removed too late in the <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>season, the bees had got at the early
ivy-blossom, and so degraded all the batch.</p>
<p>Watching bees at work of a fair morning in May, nothing
excites the wonder of the casual looker-on more than the
mysterious burdens they are for ever bringing home upon their
thighs; semi-globular packs, always gaily coloured, and often so
heavy and cumbersome that the bee can hardly drag its weary way
into the hive.&nbsp; This is pollen, to be stored in the cells,
and afterwards kneaded up with honey as food for the young
bees.&nbsp; The old man could say at once by the colour from
which flower each load was obtained.&nbsp; The deep brown-gold
panniers came from the gorse-bloom; the pure snow-white from the
hawthorns; the vivid yellow, always so big and seemingly so
weighty, had been filled in the buttercup meads.&nbsp; Now and
again, in early spring, a bee would come blundering home with a
load of pallid sea-green hue.&nbsp; This came from the gooseberry
bushes.&nbsp; And later, in summer, when the poppies began to
throw their scarlet shuttles in the corn, many of these airy
cargoes would be of a rich velvety black.&nbsp; But there was one
kind which the old bee-man had never yet succeeded in tracing to
its flowery origin.&nbsp; He saw it only rarely, perhaps not a
dozen times in the season&mdash;a wonderful deep rose-crimson,
singling out its bearer, on her passage through the throng, as
with twin danger-lamps, doubly bright in the morning glow.</p>
<p>Keeping watch over the comings and goings of his bees was
always his favourite pastime, year in and year out; but it was in
the later weeks of May that his interest in them
culminated.&nbsp; He had <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>always had swarms in May as far back
as his memory could serve him; and the oldest hive in the garden
was generally the first to swarm.&nbsp; As a rule the bees gave
sufficient warning of their intended migration some hours before
their actual issue.&nbsp; The strenuous pell-mell business of the
hive would come to a sudden portentous halt.&nbsp; While a few of
the bees still darted straight off into the sunshine on their
wonted errands, or returned with the usual motley loads upon
their thighs, the rest of the colony seemed to have abandoned
work altogether.&nbsp; From early morning they hung in a great
brown cluster all over the face of the hive, and down almost to
the earth beneath; a churning mass of insect-life that grew
bigger and bigger with every moment, glistening like wet seaweed
in the morning sun.&nbsp; In the cluster itself there was an
uncanny silence.&nbsp; But out of the depths of the hive came a
low vibrating murmur, wholly distinct from its usual note; and
every now and again a faint shrill piping sound could be heard,
as the old queen worked herself up to swarming frenzy, vainly
seeking the while to reach the royal nursery where the rival who
was to oust her from her old dominion was even then steadily
gnawing through her constraining prison walls.</p>
<p>At these momentous times a quaint ceremonial was rigidly
adhered to by the old bee-master.&nbsp; First he brought out a
pitcher of home-brewed ale, from which all who were to assist in
the swarm-taking were required to drink, as at a solemn
rite.&nbsp; The dressing of the skep was his next care.&nbsp; A
little of the beer was sprinkled over its interior, and then it
was carefully scoured out with a handful of <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>balm and
lavender and mint.&nbsp; After this the skep was covered up and
set aside in the shade; and the old bee-keeper, carrying an
ancient battered copper bowl in one gnarled hand, and a great
door-key in the other, would lead the way towards the hive, his
drab smock-frock mowing the scarlet tulip-heads down as he
went.</p>
<p>Sometimes the swarm went off without any preliminary warning,
just as if the skep had burst like a bombshell, volleying its
living contents into the sky.&nbsp; But oftener it went through
the several stages of a regular process.&nbsp; After much waiting
and many false alarms, a peculiar stir would come in the throng
of bees cumbering the entrance to the hive.&nbsp; Thousands rose
on the wing, until the sunshine overhead was charged with them as
with countless fluttering atoms of silver-foil; and a wild joyous
song spread far and wide, overpowering all other sounds in the
garden.&nbsp; Within the hive the rich bass note had ceased; and
a hissing noise, like a great caldron boiling over, took its
place, as the bees inside came pouring out to join the carolling
multitude above.&nbsp; Last of all came the queen.&nbsp; Watching
for her through the glittering gauzy atmosphere of flashing
wings, she was always strangely conspicuous, with her long
pointed body of brilliant chestnut-red.&nbsp; She came hustling
forth; stopped for an instant to comb her antenna on the edge of
the foot-board; then soared straight up into the blue, the whole
swarm crowding deliriously in her train.</p>
<p>Immediately the old bee-man commenced a weird tom-tomming on
his metal bowl.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ringing the bees&rdquo; was an exact
science with him.&nbsp; They were <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>supposed to fly higher or lower
according to the measure of the music; and now the great door-key
beat out a slow, stately chime like a cathedral bell.&nbsp;
Whether this ringing of the old-time skeppists had any real
influence on the movements of a swarm has never been absolutely
determined; but there was no doubt in this case of the
bee-keeper&rsquo;s perfect faith in the process, or that the bees
would commence their descent and settle, usually in one of the
apple trees, very soon after the din began.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of the swarm-cluster was always one of the
most bewildering things to watch.&nbsp; From a little dark knot
no bigger than the clenched hand, it swelled in a moment to the
size of a half-gallon measure, growing in girth and length with
inconceivable swiftness, until the branch began to droop under
its weight.&nbsp; A minute more, and the last of the flying bees
had joined the cluster; the stout apple-branch was bent almost
double; and the completed swarm hung within a few inches of the
ground, a long cigar-shaped mass gently swaying to and fro in the
flickering light and shade.</p>
<p>The joyous trek-song of the bees, and the clanging melody of
key and basin, died down together.&nbsp; The old murmuring,
songful quiet closed over the garden again, as water over a cast
stone.&nbsp; To hive a swarm thus easily within reach was a
simple matter.&nbsp; Soon the old bee-man had got all snugly
inside the skep, and the hive in its self-appointed
station.&nbsp; And already the bees were settling down to work;
hovering merrily about it, or packed in the fragrant darkness
busy at comb-building, or lancing off to the clover-fields, eager
to begin the task of provisioning the new home.</p>

HEREDITY IN THE BEE-GARDEN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were in the great high-road of
Warrilow bee-farm, and had stopped midway down in the heart of
the waxen city.&nbsp; On every hand the hives stretched away in
long trim rows, and the hot June sunshine was alive with darting
bees and fragrant with the smell of new-made honey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swarming?&rdquo; said the bee-master, in answer to a
question I had put to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;We never allow swarming
here.&nbsp; My bees have to work for me, and not for themselves;
so we have discarded that old-fashioned notion long
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He brought his honey-barrow to a halt, and sat down
ruminatively on the handle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swarming,&rdquo; he went on to explain, &ldquo;is the
great trouble in modern bee-keeping.&nbsp; It is a bad legacy
left us by the old-time skeppists.&nbsp; With the ancient straw
hives and the old benighted methods of working, it was all very
well.&nbsp; When bee-burning was the custom, and all the heaviest
hives were foredoomed to the sulphur-pit, the best bees were
those that gave the earliest and the largest swarms.&nbsp; The
more stocks there were in the garden the more honey there would
be for market.&nbsp; <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>Swarming was encouraged in every
possible way.&nbsp; And so, at last, the steady, stay-at-home
variety of honey-bee became exterminated, and only the inveterate
swarmers were kept to carry on the strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I quoted the time-honoured maxim about a swarm in May being
worth a load of hay.&nbsp; The bee-master laughed derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the modern bee-keeper,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a
swarm in May is little short of a disgrace.&nbsp; There is no
clearer sign of bad beemanship nowadays than when a strong colony
is allowed to weaken itself by swarming on the eve of the great
honey-flow, just when strength and numbers are most needed.&nbsp;
Of course, in the old days, the maxim held true enough.&nbsp; The
straw skeps had room only for a certain number of bees, and when
they became too crowded there was nothing for it but to let the
colonies split up in the natural way.&nbsp; But the modern
frame-hive, with its extending brood-chamber, does away with that
necessity.&nbsp; Instead of the old beggarly ten or twelve
thousand, we can now raise a population of forty or fifty
thousand bees in each hive, and so treble and quadruple the
honey-harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;do not the bees go on
swarming all the same, if you let them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old instincts die hard,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some day they will learn more scientific ways; but as yet
they have not realised the change that modern bee-keeping has
made in their condition.&nbsp; Of course, swarming has its clear,
definite purpose, apart from that of relieving the congestion of
the stock.&nbsp; When a hive swarms, the old queen goes <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>off with the
flying squadron, and a new one takes her place at home.&nbsp; In
this way there is always a young and vigorous queen at the head
of affairs, and the well-being of the parent stock is
assured.&nbsp; But advanced bee-keepers, whose sole object is to
get a large honey yield, have long recognised that this is a very
expensive way of rejuvenating old colonies.&nbsp; The parent hive
will give no surplus honey for that season; and the swarm, unless
it is a large and very early one, will do little else than
furnish its brood-nest for the coming winter.&nbsp; But if
swarming be prevented, and the stock requeened artificially every
two years, we keep an immense population always ready for the
great honey-flow, whenever it begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up the heavy barrow, laden with its pile of
super-racks, and started trundling it up the path, talking as he
went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only the bees could be persuaded to leave the
queen-raising to the bee-keeper, and would attend to nothing else
but the great business of honey-getting!&nbsp; But they
won&rsquo;t&mdash;at least, not yet.&nbsp; Perhaps in another
hundred years or so the old wild habits may be bred out of them;
but at present it is doubtful whether they are conscious of any
&lsquo;keeping&rsquo; at all.&nbsp; They go the old tried paths
determinedly; and the most that we can accomplish is to undo that
part of their work which is not to our liking, or to make a
smoother road for them in the direction they themselves have
chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said just now,&rdquo; I objected, &ldquo;that
no swarming was allowed among your bees.&nbsp; How do you manage
to prevent it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so much a question of prevention as of <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>cure.&nbsp;
Each hive must be watched carefully from the beginning.&nbsp;
From the time the queen commences to lay, in the first mild days
of spring, we keep the size of the brood nest just a little ahead
of her requirements.&nbsp; Every week or two I put in a new frame
of empty combs, and when she has ten frames to work upon, and
honey is getting plentiful, I begin to put on the store-racks
above, just as I am doing now.&nbsp; This will generally keep
them to business; but with all the care in the world the swarming
fever will sometimes set in.&nbsp; And then I always treat it in
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had stopped before one of the hives, where the bees were
hanging in a glistening brown cluster from the alighting-board;
idling while their fellows in the bee-garden seemed all possessed
with a perfect fury of work.&nbsp; I watched him as he lighted
the smoker, a sort of bellows with a wide tin funnel packed with
chips of dry rotten wood.&nbsp; He stooped over the hive, and
sent three or four dense puffs of smoke into the entrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is called subduing the bees,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;but it really does nothing of the kind.&nbsp; It only
alarms them, and a frightened bee always rushes and fills herself
with honey, to be ready for any emergency.&nbsp; She can imbibe
enough to keep her for three or four days; and once secure of
immediate want, she waits with a sort of fatalistic calm for the
development of the trouble threatening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He halted a moment or two for this process to complete itself,
then began to open the hive.&nbsp; First the roof came off; then
the woollen quilts and square of linen beneath were gradually
peeled from the tops of the comb-frames, laying bare the interior
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>of the
hive.&nbsp; Out of its dim depths came up a steady rumbling note
like a train in a tunnel, but only a few of the bees got on the
wing and began to circle round our heads viciously.&nbsp; The
frames hung side by side, with a space of half an inch or so
between.&nbsp; The bee-master lifted them out carefully one by
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, see here,&rdquo; he said, as he held up the first
frame in the sunlight, with the bees clinging in thousands to it,
&ldquo;this end comb ought to have nothing but honey in it, but
you see its centre is covered with brood-cells.&nbsp; The queen
has caught the bee-man napping, and has extended her nursery to
the utmost limit of the hive.&nbsp; She is at the end of her
tether, and has therefore decided to swarm.&nbsp; Directly the
bees see this they begin to prepare for the coming loss of their
queen by raising another, and to make sure of getting one they
always breed three or four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out the next comb and pointed to a round construction,
about the size and shape of an acorn, hanging from its lower
edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a queen cell; and here, on the next comb, are
two more.&nbsp; One is sealed over, you see, and may hatch out at
any moment; and the others are nearly ready for closing.&nbsp;
They are always carefully guarded, or the old queen would destroy
them.&nbsp; And now to put an end to the swarming fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out all the combs but the four centre ones; and, with
a goose wing, gently brushed the bees off them into the
hive.&nbsp; The six combs were then taken to the
extricating-house hard by.&nbsp; The sealed honey-cells on all of
them were swiftly uncapped, and the honey thrown out by a turn or
two <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>in the
centrifugal machine.&nbsp; Now we went back to the hive.&nbsp;
Right in the centre the bee-master put a new, perfectly empty
comb, and on each side of this came the four principal brood
frames with the queen still on them.&nbsp; Outside of these again
the combs from which we had extracted all the honey were brought
into position.&nbsp; And then a rack of new sections was placed
over all, and the hive quickly closed up.&nbsp; The entire
process seemed the work of only a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the bee-master triumphantly, as he
took up his barrow again, &ldquo;we have changed the whole aspect
of affairs.&nbsp; The population of the hive is as big as ever;
but instead of a house of plenty it is a house of dearth.&nbsp;
The larder is empty, and the only cure for impending famine is
hard work; and the bees will soon find that out and set to
again.&nbsp; Moreover, the queen has now plenty of room for
laying everywhere, and those exasperating prison-cradles, with
her future rivals hatching in them, have been done away
with.&nbsp; She has no further reason for flight, and the bees,
having had all their preparations destroyed, have the best of
reasons for keeping her.&nbsp; Above all, there is the new
super-rack, greatly increasing the hive space, and they will be
given a second and third rack, or even a fourth one, long before
they feel the want of it.&nbsp; Every motive for swarming has
been removed, and the result to the bee-master will probably be
seventy or eighty pounds of surplus honey, instead of none at
all, if the bees had been left to their old prim&aelig;val
ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must always remember, however,&rdquo; he added, as
a final word, &ldquo;that bees do nothing <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>invariably.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis an old and threadbare
saying amongst bee-keepers, but there&rsquo;s nothing truer under
the sun.&nbsp; Bees have exceptions to almost every rule.&nbsp;
While all other creatures seem to keep blindly to one
pre-ordained way in everything they do, you can never be certain
at any time that bees will not reverse their ordinary course to
meet circumstances you may know nothing of.&nbsp; And that is all
the more reason why the bee-master himself should allow no
deviations in his own work about the hives: his ways must be as
the ways of the Medes and Persians.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
NIGHT ON A HONEY-FARM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sweet summer dusk was over the
bee-farm.&nbsp; On every side, as I passed through, the starlight
showed me the crowding roofs of the city of hives; and beyond
these I could just make out the dim outline of the
extracting-house, with a cheerful glow of lamplight streaming out
from window and door.&nbsp; The rumble of machinery and the
voices of the bee-master and his men grew louder as I
approached.&nbsp; A great business seemed to be going forward
within.&nbsp; In the centre of the building stood a
strange-looking engine, like a brewer&rsquo;s vat on legs.&nbsp;
It was eight or nine feet broad and some five feet high; and a
big horizontal wheel lay within the great circle, completely
filling its whole circumference.&nbsp; As I entered, the wheel
was going round with a deep reverberating noise as fast as two
strong men could work the gearing; and the bee-master stood close
by, carefully timing the operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp; The great
wheel-of-fortune stopped.&nbsp; A long iron bar was pulled down
and the wheel rose out of the vat.&nbsp; Now I could see that its
whole outer periphery was covered with <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>frames of honeycomb, each in its
separate gauze-wire cage.&nbsp; The bee-master tugged a
lever.&nbsp; The cages&mdash;there must have been twenty-five or
thirty of them&mdash;turned over simultaneously like single
leaves of a book, bringing the other side of each comb into
place.&nbsp; The wheel dropped down once more, and swung round
again on its giddy journey.&nbsp; From my place by the door I
could hear the honey driving out against the sides of the vat
like heavy rain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried the bee-master again.&nbsp; Once
more the big wheel rose, glistening and dripping, into the yellow
lamplight.&nbsp; And now a trolley was pushed up laden with more
honeycomb ready for extraction.&nbsp; The wire-net cages were
opened, the empty combs taken out, and full ones deftly put in
their place.&nbsp; The wheel plunged down again into its
mellifluous cavern, and began its deep song once more.&nbsp; The
bee-master gave up his post to the foreman, and came towards me,
wiping the honey from his hands.&nbsp; He was very proud of his
big extractor, and quite willing to explain the whole
process.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the old days,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
only way to get the honey from the comb was to press it
out.&nbsp; You could not obtain your honey without destroying the
comb, which at this season of the year is worth very much more
than the honey itself; for if the combs can be emptied and
restored perfect to the hive, the bees will fill them again
immediately, without having to waste valuable time in the height
of the honey-flow by stopping to make new combs.&nbsp; And when
the bees are wax-making they are not only prevented from
gathering honey, but have to consume their own <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>stores.&nbsp;
While they are making one pound of comb they will eat seventeen
or eighteen pounds of honey.&nbsp; So the man who hit upon the
idea of drawing the honey from the comb by centrifugal force did
a splendid thing for modern bee-farming.&nbsp; English honey was
nothing until the extractor came and changed bee-keeping from a
mere hobby into an important industry.&nbsp; But come and see how
the thing is done from the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>He led the way towards one end of the building.&nbsp; Here
three or four men were at work at a long table surrounded by
great stacks of honeycombs in their oblong wooden frames.&nbsp;
The bee-master took up one of these.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he
explained, &ldquo;is the bar-frame just as it comes from the
hive.&nbsp; Ten of them side by side exactly fill a box that goes
over the hive proper.&nbsp; The queen stays below in the
brood-nest, but the worker bees come to the top to store the
honey.&nbsp; Then, every two or three days, when the honey-flow
is at its fullest, we open the super, take out the sealed combs,
and put in combs that have been emptied by the extractor.&nbsp;
In a few days these also are filled and capped by the bees, and
are replaced by more empty combs in the same way; and so it goes
on to the end of the honey-harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stood for a minute or two watching the work at the
table.&nbsp; It went on at an extraordinary pace.&nbsp; Each
workman seized one of the frames and poised it vertically over a
shallow metal tray.&nbsp; Then, from a vessel of steaming hot
water that stood at his elbow, he drew the long, flat-headed
Bingham knife, and with one swift slithering cut removed the
whole of the cell-tappings from the surface of the comb.&nbsp; At
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>once the
knife was thrown back into its smoking bath, and a second one
taken out, with which the other side of the comb was
treated.&nbsp; Then the comb was hung in the rack of the trolley,
and the keen hot blades went to work on another frame.&nbsp; As
each trolley was fully loaded it was whisked off to the
extracting-machine and another took its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this work,&rdquo; explained the bee-master, as we
passed on, &ldquo;is done after dark, because in the daytime the
bees would smell the honey and would besiege us.&nbsp; So we
cannot begin extracting until they are all safely hived for the
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped before a row of bulky
cylinders.&nbsp; &ldquo;These,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are the
honey ripeners.&nbsp; Each of them holds about twenty gallons,
and all the honey is kept here for three or four days to mature
before it is ready for market.&nbsp; If we were to send it out at
once it would ferment and spoil.&nbsp; In the top of each drum
there are fine wire strainers, and the honey must run through
these, and finally through thick flannel, before it gets into the
cylinder.&nbsp; Then, when it is ripe, it is drawn off and
bottled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the big cylinders was being tapped at the moment.&nbsp;
A workman came up with a kind of gardener&rsquo;s water-tank on
wheels.&nbsp; The valve of the honey-vat was opened, and the rich
fluid came gushing out like liquid amber.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is
all white-clover honey,&rdquo; said the bee-master, tasting it
critically.&nbsp; &ldquo;The next vat there ought to be pure
sainfoin.&nbsp; Sometimes the honey has a distinct almond
flavour; that is when hawthorn is abundant.&nbsp; Honey varies as
much as wine.&nbsp; It is good or bad according to the soil and
the season.&nbsp; Where the horse-chestnut is plentiful the honey
has generally a rank <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>taste.&nbsp; But this is a
sheep-farmers&rsquo; country, where they grow thousands of acres
of rape and lucerne and clover for sheep-feed; and nothing could
be better for the bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the gardener&rsquo;s barrow was full to the
brim.&nbsp; We followed it as it was trundled heavily away to
another part of the building.&nbsp; Here a little company of
women were busy filling the neat glass jars, with their bright
screw-covers of tin; pasting on the label of the big London
stores, whither most of the honey was sent; and packing the jars
into their travelling-cases ready for the railway-van in the
morning.&nbsp; The whole place reeked with the smell of new honey
and the faint, indescribable odour of the hives.&nbsp; As we
passed out of the busy scene of the extracting-house into the
moist dark night again, this peculiar fragrance struck upon us
overpoweringly.&nbsp; The slow wind was setting our way, and the
pungent odour from the hives came up on it with a solid, almost
stifling, effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are fanning hard to-night,&rdquo; said the
bee-master, as we stopped halfway down the garden.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Listen to the noise they&rsquo;re making!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moon was just tilting over the tree-tops.&nbsp; In its dim
light the place looked double its actual size.&nbsp; We seemed to
stand in the midst of a great town of bee-dwellings, stretching
vaguely away into the darkness.&nbsp; And from every hive there
rose the clear deep murmur of the ventilating bees.</p>
<p>The bee-master lighted his lantern, and held it down close to
the entrance of the nearest hive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look how they form up in rows, one behind the others
with their heads to the hive; and all <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>fanning with their wings!&nbsp; They
are drawing the hot air out.&nbsp; Inside there is another
regiment of them, but those are facing the opposite way, and
drawing the cool air in.&nbsp; And so they keep the hive always
at the right temperature for honey-making, and for hatching out
the young bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it,&rdquo; he asked ruminatively, as the gate
of the bee-farm closed at last behind us, and we were walking
homeward through the glimmering dusk of the lane&mdash;&ldquo;who
was it first spoke of the &lsquo;busy bee&rsquo;?&nbsp;
Busy!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not the word for it!&nbsp; Why, from the
moment she is born to the day she dies the bee never rests nor
sleeps!&nbsp; It is hard work night and day, from the cradle-cell
to the grave; and in the honey-season she dies of it after a
month or so.&nbsp; It is only the drone that rests.&nbsp; He is
very like some humans I know of his own sex; he lives an idle
life, and leaves the work to the womenkind.&nbsp; But the drone
has to pay for it in the end, for the drudging woman-bee revolts
sooner or later.&nbsp; And then she kills him.&nbsp; In bee-life
the drone always dies a violent death; but in human
life&mdash;well, it seems to me a little bee-justice
wouldn&rsquo;t be amiss with some of them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
IN A BEE-CAMP</h2>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> a good
thing&mdash;life; but ye never know how good, really, till
you&rsquo;ve followed the bees to the heather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an old saying of the bee-master&rsquo;s, and it came
again slowly from his lips now, as he knelt by the camp-fire,
watching the caress of the flames round the bubbling pot.&nbsp;
We were in the heart of the Sussex moorland, miles away from the
nearest village, still farther from the great bee-farm where, at
other times, the old man drove his thriving trade.&nbsp; But the
bees were here&mdash;a million of them perhaps&mdash;all singing
their loudest in the blossoming heather that stretched away on
every side to the far horizon, under the sweltering August
sun.</p>
<p>Getting the bees to the moors was always the chief event of
the year down at the honey-farm.&nbsp; For days the waggons stood
by the laneside, all ready to be loaded up with the best and most
populous hives; but the exact moment of departure depended on one
very uncertain factor.&nbsp; The white-clover crop was almost at
an end.&nbsp; Every day saw the acreage of sainfoin narrowing, as
the <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>sheep-folds closed in upon it, leaving nothing but bare
yellow waste, where had been a rolling sea of crimson
blossom.&nbsp; But the charlock lay on every hillside like
cloth-of-gold.&nbsp; Until harvest was done the fallows were safe
from the ploughshare, and what proved little else than a
troublesome weed to the farmer was like golden guineas growing to
every keeper of bees.</p>
<p>But at last the new moon brought a sharp chilly night with it,
and the long-awaited signal was given.&nbsp; Coming down with the
first grey glint of morning from the little room under the
thatch, I found the bee-garden in a swither of commotion.&nbsp; A
faint smell of carbolic was on the air, and the shadowy figures
of the bee-master and his men were hurrying from hive to hive,
taking off the super-racks that stood on many three and four
stories high.&nbsp; The honey-barrows went to and fro groaning
under their burdens; and the earliest bees, roused from their
rest by this unwonted turmoil, filled the grey dusk with their
high timorous note.</p>
<p>The bee-master came over to me in his white overalls, a weird
apparition in the half-darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the honey-dew,&rdquo; he said, out of
breath, as he passed by.&nbsp; &ldquo;The first cold night of
summer brings it out thick on every oak-leaf for miles around;
and if we don&rsquo;t get the supers off before the bees can
gather it, the honey will be blackened and spoiled for
market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He carried a curious bundle with him, an armful of fluttering
pieces of calico, and I followed him as he went to work on a
fresh row of hives.&nbsp; From each bee-dwelling the roof was
thrown off, the inner coverings removed, and one of the squares
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>of
cloth&mdash;damped with the carbolic solution&mdash;quickly drawn
over the topmost rack.&nbsp; A sudden fearsome buzzing uprose
within, and then a sudden silence.&nbsp; There is nothing in the
world a bee dreads more than the smell of carbolic acid.&nbsp; In
a few seconds the super-racks were deserted, the bees crowding
down into the lowest depths of the hives.&nbsp; The creaking
barrows went down the long row in the track of the master, taking
up the heavy racks as they passed.&nbsp; Before the sun was well
up over the hill-brow the last load had been safely gathered in,
and the chosen hives were being piled into the waggons, ready for
the long day&rsquo;s journey to the moors.</p>
<p>All this was but a week ago; yet it might have been a week of
years, so completely had these rose-red highland solitudes
accepted our invasion, and absorbed us into their daily round of
sun and song.&nbsp; Here, in a green hollow of velvet turf, right
in the heart of the wilderness, the camp had been
pitched&mdash;the white bell-tents with their skirts drawn up,
showing the spindle-legged field-bedsteads within; the
filling-house, made of lath and gauze, where the racks could be
emptied and recharged with the little white wood section-boxes,
safe from marauding bees; the honey-store, with its bee-proof
crates steadily mounting one upon the other, laden with rich
brown heather-honey&mdash;the finest sweet-food in the
world.&nbsp; And round the camp, in a vast spreading circle,
stood the hives&mdash;a hundred or more&mdash;knee-deep in the
rosy thicket, each facing outward, and each a whirling vortex of
life from early dawn to the last amber gleam of sunset abiding
under the flinching silver of the stars.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>The
camp-fire crackled and hissed, and the pot sent forth a savoury
steam into the morning air.&nbsp; From the heather the deep chant
of busy thousands came over on the wings of the breeze, bringing
with it the very spirit of serene content.&nbsp; The bee-master
rose and stirred the pot ruminatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;B&rsquo;iled rabbit!&rdquo; said he, looking up, with
the light of old memories coming in his gnarled brown face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And forty years ago, when I first came to the heather, it
used to be b&rsquo;iled rabbit too.&nbsp; We could set a snare in
those days as well as now.&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas only a few hives
then, a dozen or so of old straw skeps on a barrow, and naught
but the starry night for a roof-tree, or a sack or two to keep
off the rain.&nbsp; None of your women&rsquo;s luxuries in those
times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked round rather disparagingly at his own tent, with its
plain truckle-bed, and tin wash-bowl, and other deplorable signs
of effeminate self-indulgence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there was one thing,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;one
thing we used to bring to the moors that never comes now.&nbsp;
And that was the basket of sulphur-rag.&nbsp; When the honey-flow
is done, and the waggons come to fetch us home again, all the
hives will go back to their places in the garden none the worse
for their trip.&nbsp; But in the old days of bee-burning never a
bee of all the lot returned from the moors.&nbsp; Come a little
way into the long grass yonder, and I&rsquo;ll show ye the way of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a stick he threshed about in the dry bents, and soon lay
bare a row of circular cavities in the ground.&nbsp; They were
almost choked up with moss and the rank undergrowth of many years
but <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>originally they must have been each about ten inches
broad by as many deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said the bee-master, with a shamefaced
air of confession, &ldquo;were the sulphur-pits.&nbsp; I dug them
the first year I ever brought hives to the heather; and here, for
twenty seasons or more, some of the finest and strongest stocks
in Sussex were regularly done to death.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a drab
tale to tell, but we knew no better then.&nbsp; To get the honey
away from the bees looked well-nigh impossible with thousands of
them clinging all over the combs.&nbsp; And it never occurred to
any of us to try the other way, and get the bees to leave the
honey.&nbsp; Yet bee-driving, &rsquo;tis the simplest thing in
the world, as every village lad knows to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We strolled out amongst the hives, and the bee-master began
his leisurely morning round of inspection.&nbsp; In the bee-camp,
life and work alike took their time from the slow march of the
summer sun, deliberate, imperturbable, across the pathless
heaven.&nbsp; The bees alone keep up the heat and burden of the
day.&nbsp; While they were charging in and out of the hives,
possessed with a perfect fury of labour, the long hours of
sunshine went by for us in immemorial calm.&nbsp; Like the steady
rise and fall of a windless tide, darkness and day succeeded one
another; and the morning splash in the dew-pond on the top of the
hill, and the song by the camp-fire at night, seemed divided only
by a dim formless span too uneventful and happy to be called by
the old portentous name of Time.</p>
<p>And yet every moment had its business, not to be delayed
beyond its imminent season.&nbsp; Down in the bee-farm the work
of honey-harvesting always <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>carried with it a certain stress and
bustle.&nbsp; The great centrifugal extractor would be roaring
half the night through, emptying the super-combs, which were to
be put back into the hives on the morrow, and refilled by the
bees.&nbsp; But here, on the moors, modern bee-science is
powerless to hurry the work of the sunshine.&nbsp; The thick
heather-honey defies the extracting-machine, and cannot be
separated without destroying the comb.&nbsp; Moorland
honey&mdash;except where the wild sage is plentiful enough to
thin down the heather sweets&mdash;must be left in the virgin
comb; and the bee-man can do little more than look on as
vigilantly as may be at the work of his singing battalions, and
keep the storage-space of the hives always well in advance of
their need.</p>
<p>Yet there is one danger&mdash;contingent at all seasons of
bee-life, but doubly to be guarded against during the critical
time of the honey-flow.</p>
<p>As we loitered round the great circle, the old bee-keeper
halted in the rear of every hive to watch the contending streams
of workers, the one rippling out into the blue air and sunshine,
the other setting more steadily homeward, each bee weighed down
with her load of nectar and pale grey pollen, as she scrambled
desperately through the opposing crowd and vanished into the
seething darkness within.&nbsp; As we passed each hive, the old
bee-man carefully noted its strength and spirit, comparing it
with the condition of its neighbours on either hand.&nbsp; At
last he stopped by one of the largest hives, and pointed to it
significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can ye see aught amiss?&rdquo; he asked, hastily
rolling his shirt-sleeves up to the armpit.</p>
<p>I looked, but could detect nothing wrong.&nbsp; The <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>multitude
round the entrance to this hive seemed larger and busier than
with any other, and the note within as deeply resonant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay! they&rsquo;re erpulous enough,&rdquo; said the
bee-master, as he lighted his tin-nozzled bellows-smoker and
coaxed it into full blast.&nbsp; &ldquo;But hark to the
din!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis not work this time; &rsquo;tis mortal fear
of something.&nbsp; Flying strong?&nbsp; Ah, but only a yard or
two up, and back again.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s trouble at hand, and
they&rsquo;ve only just found it out.&nbsp; The matter is, they
have lost their queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was hurriedly removing the different parts of the hive as
he spoke.&nbsp; A few quick puffs from the smoker were all that
was needed at such a time.&nbsp; With no thought but for the
tragedy that had come upon them, the bees were rushing madly to
and fro in the hive, not paying the slightest attention to the
fact that their house was falling asunder piecemeal and the
sudden sunshine riddling it through and through, where had been
nothing but Cimmerian darkness before.&nbsp; Under the steady
slow hand of the master, the teeming section-racks came off one
by one, until the lowest chamber&mdash;the nursery of the
hive&mdash;was reached, and a note like imprisoned thunder in
miniature burst out upon us.</p>
<p>The old bee-keeper lifted out the brood-frames, and subjected
each to a lynx-eyed scrutiny.&nbsp; At last he dived his bare
hand down into the thick of the bees, and brought up something to
show me.&nbsp; It was the dead queen; twice the size of all the
rest, with short oval wings and a shining red-gold body,
strangely conspicuous among the score or so of dun-coloured
workers which still crowded round her on the palm of his
hand.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;In the old days,&rdquo; said the bee-master,
&ldquo;before the movable-comb hive was invented, if the queen
died like this, it would throw the whole colony out of gear for
the rest of the season.&nbsp; Three weeks must elapse before a
new queen could be hatched and got ready for work; and then the
honey-harvest would be over.&nbsp; But see how precious time can
be saved under the modern system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to a hive which stood some distance apart from
the rest.&nbsp; It was much smaller than the others, and
consisted merely of a row of little boxes, each with its separate
entrance, but all under one common roof.&nbsp; The old bee-man
opened one of the compartments, and lifted out its single
comb-frame, on which were clustered only a few hundred
bees.&nbsp; Searching among these with a wary forefinger, at last
he seized one by the wings and held it up to view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a spare queen,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis always wise to bring a few to the heather,
against any mischance.&nbsp; And now we&rsquo;ll give her to the
motherless bees; and in an hour or two the stock will be at work
again as busily as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
THE BEE-HUNTERS</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">In</span> that bit of
forest,&rdquo; said the bee-master, indicating a long stretch of
neighbouring woodland with one comprehensive sweep of his thumb,
&ldquo;there are tons of honey waiting for any man who knows how
to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had met and stopped the old bee-keeper and his men, bent on
what seemed a rather singular undertaking.&nbsp; They carried
none of the usual implements of their craft, but were laden up
with the paraphernalia of woodmen&mdash;rip-saws and hatchets and
climbing-irons, and a mysterious box or two, the use of which I
could not even guess at.&nbsp; But the bee-master soon made his
errand plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tons of honey,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we
are going to look for some of it.&nbsp; There have been wild
bees, I suppose, in the forest country from the beginning of
things.&nbsp; Then see how the land lies.&nbsp; There are
villages all round, and for ages past swarms have continually got
away from the bee-gardens, and hived themselves in the hollow
trunks <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>of
the trees.&nbsp; Then every year these stray colonies have sent
out their own swarms again, until to-day the woods are full of
bees, wild as wolves and often as savage, guarding stores that
have been accumulating perhaps for years and years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shifted his heavy kit from one shoulder to the other.&nbsp;
Overhead the sun burned in a cloudless August sky, and the
willow-herb by the roadside was full of singing bees and the
flicker of white butterflies.&nbsp; In the hedgerows there were
more bees plundering the blackberry blossom, or sounding their
vagrant note in the white convolvulus-bells which hung in bridal
wreaths at every turn of the way.&nbsp; Beyond the hedgerow the
yellow cornlands flowed away over hill and dale under the torrid
light; and each scarlet poppy that hid in the rustling gold-brown
wheat had its winged musician chanting at its portal.&nbsp; As I
turned and went along with the expedition, the bee-master gave me
more details of the coming enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is not good
beemanship as the moderns understand it.&nbsp; It is nothing but
bee-murder, of the old-fashioned kind.&nbsp; But even if the bees
could be easily taken alive, we should not want them in the
apiary.&nbsp; Blood counts in bee-life, as in everything else;
and these forest-bees have been too long under the old natural
conditions to be of any use among the domestic strain.&nbsp;
However, the honey is worth the getting, and if we can land only
one big stock or two it will be a profitable day&rsquo;s
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had left the hot, dusty lane, and taken to the field-path
leading up through a sea of white clover to the woods above.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>&ldquo;This is the after-crop,&rdquo; said the
bee-master, as he strode on ahead with his jingling burden.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The second cut of Dutch clover always gives the most
honey.&nbsp; Listen to the bees everywhere&mdash;it is just like
the roar of London heard from the top of St Paul&rsquo;s!&nbsp;
And most of it here is going into the woods, more&rsquo;s the
pity.&nbsp; Well, well; we must try to get some of it back
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the verge of the clover-field and the shadowy depths
of the forest ran a broad green waggon-way; and here we came to a
halt.&nbsp; In the field we had lately traversed the deep note of
the bees had sounded mainly underfoot; but now it was all above
us, as the honeymakers sped to and fro between the sunlit plane
of blossom and their hidden storehouses in the wood.&nbsp; The
upper air was full of their music; but, straining the sight to
its utmost, not a bee could be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will never see them,&rdquo; said the
bee-master, watching me as he unpacked his kit.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
fly too fast and too high.&nbsp; And if you can&rsquo;t see them
go by out here in the broad sunshine, how will you track them to
their lair through the dim light under the trees?&nbsp; And
yet,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that is the only way to do
it.&nbsp; It is useless to search the wood for their nests; you
might travel the whole day through and find nothing.&nbsp; The
only plan is to follow the laden bees returning to the
hive.&nbsp; And now watch how we do that in Sussex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From one of the boxes he produced a contrivance like a flat
tin saucer mounted on top of a pointed stick.&nbsp; He stuck this
in the ground near the edge of the clover-field so that the
saucer stood on a <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>level with the highest blossoms.&nbsp; Now he took a
small bottle of honey from his pocket, emptied it into the tin
receptacle, and beckoned me to come near.&nbsp; Already three or
four bees had discovered this unawaited feast and settled on it;
a minute more and the saucer was black with crowding bees.&nbsp;
Now the bee-master took a wire-gauze cover and softly inverted it
over the saucer.&nbsp; Then, plucking his ingenious trap up by
the roots, he set off towards the forest with his prisoners,
followed by his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are our guides to the
secret treasure-chamber.&nbsp; Without them we might look for a
week and never find it.&nbsp; But now it is all plain sailing, as
you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pulled up on the edge of the wood.&nbsp; By this time every
bee in the trap had forsaken the honey, and was clambering about
in the top of the dome-shaped lid, eager for flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all full of honey,&rdquo; said the bee-master,
&ldquo;and the first thing a fully-laden bee thinks of is
home.&nbsp; And now we will set the first one on the
wing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened a small valve in the trap-cover, and allowed one of
the bees to escape.&nbsp; She rose into the air, made a short
circle, then sped away into the gloom of the wood.&nbsp; In a
moment she was lost to sight, but the main direction of her
course was clear; and we all followed helter-skelter until our
leader called another halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now watch this one,&rdquo; he said, pressing the valve
again.</p>
<p>This time the guide rose high into the dim air, and was at
once lost to my view.&nbsp; But <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>the keen eyes of the old bee-man had
challenged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she goes!&rdquo; he said, pointing down a long
shadowy glade somewhat to his left.&nbsp; &ldquo;Watch that bit
of sunlight away yonder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed this indication.&nbsp; Through the dense
wood-canopy a hundred feet away the sun had thrust one long
golden tentacle; and I saw a tiny spark of light flash through
into the gloom beyond.&nbsp; We all stampeded after it.</p>
<p>Another and another of the guides was set free, each one
taking us deeper into the heart of the forest, until at last the
bee-master suddenly stopped and held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said under his breath.</p>
<p>Above the rustling of the leaves, above the quiet stir of the
undergrowth and the crooning of the stock-doves, a shrill
insistent note came over to us on the gentle wind.&nbsp; The
bee-man led the way silently into the darkest depths of the
wood.&nbsp; Halting, listening, going swiftly forward in turn, at
last he stopped at the foot of an old decayed elm-stump.&nbsp;
The shrill note we had heard was much louder now, and right
overhead.&nbsp; Following his pointing forefinger, I saw a dark
cleft in the old trunk about twenty feet above; and round this a
cloud of bees was circling, filling the air with their rich deep
labour-song.&nbsp; At the same instant, with a note like the
twang of a harp-string, a bee came at me and fastened a red-hot
fish-hook into my cheek.&nbsp; The old bee-keeper laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get this on as soon as you can,&rdquo; he said,
producing a pocketful of bee-veils, and handing me one from the
bunch.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are wild bees, thirty <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>thousand of
them, maybe; and we shall need all our armour to-day.&nbsp; Only
wait till they find us out!&nbsp; But now rub your hands all over
with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man scrambled into his veil, and anointed his hands with
the oil of wintergreen&mdash;the one abiding terror of vindictive
bees.&nbsp; And then the real business of the day commenced.</p>
<p>The bee-master had strapped on his climbing-irons.&nbsp; Now
he struck his way slowly up the tree, tapping the wood with the
butt-end of a hatchet inch by inch as he went.&nbsp; At last he
found what he wanted.&nbsp; The trunk rang hollow about a dozen
feet from the ground.&nbsp; Immediately he began to cut it
away.&nbsp; The noise of the hatchet woke all the echoes of the
forest.&nbsp; The chips came fluttering to the earth.&nbsp; The
rich murmur overhead changed to an angry buzzing.&nbsp; In a
moment the bees were on the worker in a vortex of humming fury,
covering his veil, his clothes, his hands.&nbsp; But he worked on
unconcernedly until he had driven a large hole through the crust
of the tree and laid bare the glistening honeycomb within.&nbsp;
Now I saw him take from a sling-bag at his side handful after
handful of some yellow substance and heap it into the cavity he
had made.&nbsp; Then he struck a match, lighted the stuff, and
came sliding swiftly to earth again.&nbsp; We all drew off and
waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; explained the bee-master, as he leaned on
his woodman&rsquo;s axe out of breath, &ldquo;is cotton-waste,
soaked in creosote, and then smothered in powdered
brimstone.&nbsp; See! it is burning famously.&nbsp; The fumes
will soon fill the hollow of the tree and settle the whole
company.&nbsp; Then we shall cut away <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>enough of the rotten wood above to
get all the best of the combs out; there are eighty pounds of
good honey up there, or I&rsquo;m no bee-man.&nbsp; And then
it&rsquo;s back to the clover-field for more guide-bees, and away
on a new scent.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>CHAPTER X<br />
THE PHYSICIAN IN THE HIVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a strange procession coming
up the red-tiled path of the bee garden.&nbsp; The bee-master led
the way in his Sunday clothes, followed by a gorgeous footman,
powdered and cockaded, who carried an armful of wraps and
cushions.&nbsp; Behind him walked two more, supporting between
them a kind of carrying-chair, in which sat a florid old
gentleman in a Scotch plaid shawl; and behind these again strode
a silk-hatted, black-frocked man carefully regulating the
progress of the cavalcade.&nbsp; Through the rain of autumn
leaves, on the brisk October morning, I could see, afar off, a
carriage waiting by the lane-side; a big old-fashioned family
vehicle, with cockaded servants, a pair of champing greys, and a
glitter of gold and scarlet on the panel, where the sunbeams
struck on an elaborate coat-of-arms.</p>
<p>The whole procession made for the extracting-house, and all
work stopped at its approach.&nbsp; The great centrifugal machine
ceased its humming.&nbsp; The doors of the packing-room were
closed, shutting as the din of saw and hammer.&nbsp; Over the
stone <a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>floor in front of the furnace&mdash;where a big caldron
of metheglin was simmering&mdash;a carpet was hastily unrolled,
and a comfortable couch brought out and set close to the cheery
blaze.</p>
<p>And now the strangest part of the proceedings commenced.&nbsp;
The old gentleman was brought in, partially disrobed, and
transferred to the couch by the fireside.&nbsp; He seemed in
great trepidation about something.&nbsp; He kept his gold
eyeglasses turned on the bee-master, watching him with a sort of
terrified wonder, as the old bee-man produced a mysterious box,
with a lid of perforated zinc, and laid it on the table close
by.&nbsp; From my corner the whole scene was strongly reminiscent
of the ogre&rsquo;s kitchen in the fairy-tale; and the muffled
sounds from the packing-room might have been the voice of the
ogre himself, complaining at the lateness of his dinner.</p>
<p>Now, at a word from the black-coated man, the bee-master
opened his box.&nbsp; A loud angry buzzing uprose, and about a
dozen bees escaped into the air, and flew straight for the
window-glass.&nbsp; The bee-master followed them, took one
carefully by the wings, and brought it over to the old
gentleman.&nbsp; His apprehensions visibly redoubled.&nbsp; The
doctor seized him in an iron, professional grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just here, I think.&nbsp; Close under the
shoulder-blade.&nbsp; Now, your lordship . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Viciously the infuriated bee struck home.&nbsp; For eight or
ten seconds she worked her wicked will on the patient.&nbsp;
Then, turning round and round, she at last drew out her sting,
and darted back to the window.</p>
<p>But the bee-master was ready with another of his living
stilettos.&nbsp; Half a dozen times the operation <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>was repeated
on various parts of the suffering patient&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;
Then the old gentleman&mdash;who, by this time, had passed from
whimpering through the various stages of growing indignation to
sheer undisguised profanity&mdash;was restored to his
apparel.&nbsp; The procession was re-formed, and the bee-master
conducted it to the waiting carriage, with the same ceremony as
before.</p>
<p>As we stood looking after the retreating vehicle, the old
bee-man entered into explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is Lord H&mdash;, and he
has been a martyr to rheumatism these ten years back.&nbsp; I
could have cured him long ago if he had only come to me before,
as I have done many a poor soul in these parts; but he, and those
like him, are the last to hear of the physician in the
hive.&nbsp; He will begin to get better now, as you will
see.&nbsp; He is to be brought here every fortnight; but in a
month or two he will not need the chair.&nbsp; And before the
winter is out he will walk again as well as the best of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went slowly back through the bee-farm.&nbsp; The
working-song of the bees seemed as loud as ever in the keen
October sunshine.&nbsp; But the steady deep note of summer was
gone; and the peculiar bee-voice of autumn&mdash;shrill, anxious,
almost vindictive&mdash;rang out on every side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued the bee-master,
&ldquo;there is nothing new in this treatment of rheumatism by
bee-stings.&nbsp; It is literally as old as the hills.&nbsp;
Every bee-keeper for the last two thousand years has known of
it.&nbsp; But it is as much as a preventive as a cure that the
acid in a bee&rsquo;s sting is valuable.&nbsp; The rarest thing
in the world is to find a bee-keeper <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>suffering from rheumatism.&nbsp; And
if every one kept bees, and got stung occasionally, the doctors
would soon have one ailment the less to trouble about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;there is something much
pleasanter and more valuable to humanity, ill or well, to be got
from the hives.&nbsp; And that is the honey itself.&nbsp; Honey
is good for old and young.&nbsp; If mothers were wise they would
never give their children any other sweet food.&nbsp; Pure ripe
honey is sugar with the most difficult and most important part of
digestion already accomplished by the bees.&nbsp; Moreover, it is
a safe and very gentle laxative.&nbsp; And probably, before each
comb-cell is sealed up, the bee injects a drop of acid from her
sting.&nbsp; Anyway, honey has a distinct aseptic property.&nbsp;
That is why it is so good for sore throats or chafed
skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had got back to the extracting house, where the great
caldron of metheglin was still bubbling over the fire.&nbsp; The
old bee-keeper relieved himself of his stiff Sunday coat, donned
his white linen overalls, and fell to skimming the pot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is another use,&rdquo; said he, after a
ruminative pause, &ldquo;to which honey might be put, if only
doctors could be induced to seek curative power in ancient homely
things, as they do with the latest new poisons from
Germany.&nbsp; That is in the treatment of obesity.&nbsp; Fat
people, who are ordered to give up sugar, ought to use honey
instead.&nbsp; In my time I have persuaded many a one to try it,
and the result has always been the same&mdash;a steady reduction
in weight, and better health all round.&nbsp; Then, again,
dyspeptic folk would find most of their troubles vanish if they
substituted the already <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>half-digested honey wherever ordinary
sugar forms part of their diet.&nbsp; And did you ever try honey
to sweeten tea or coffee?&nbsp; Of course, it must be pure, and
without any strongly-marked flavour; but no one would ever return
to sugar if once good honey had been tried in this way, or in any
kind of cookery where sugar is used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bee-master ran his fingers through his hair, of which he
had a magnificent iron-grey crop.&nbsp; The fingers were
undeniably sticky; but it was an old habit of his, when in
thoughtful mood, and the action seemed to remind him of
something.&nbsp; His eyes twinkled merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are a writer for the
papers, and you may therefore want to go into the hair-restoring
business some day.&nbsp; Well, here is a recipe for you.&nbsp; It
is nothing but honey and water, in equal parts, but it is highly
recommended by all the ancient writers on beemanship.&nbsp; Have
I tried it?&nbsp; Well, no; at least, not intentionally.&nbsp;
But in extracting honey it gets into most places, the hair not
excepted.&nbsp; At any rate, honey as a hair-restorer was one of
the most famous nostrums of the Middle Ages, and may return to
popular favour even now.&nbsp; However, here is something there
can be no question about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to a cupboard, and brought out a jar full of a viscid
yellow substance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is an embrocation, and it
is the finest thing I know for sprains and bruises.&nbsp; It is
made of the wax from old combs, dissolved in turpentine, and if
we got nothing else from the hives bee-keeping would yet be
justified as a humanitarian calling.&nbsp; Its virtues may be in
the <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>wax,
or they may be due to the turpentine, but probably they lie in
another direction altogether.&nbsp; Bees collect a peculiar
resinous matter from pine trees and elsewhere, with which they
varnish the whole surface of their combs, and this may be the
real curative element in the stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, with a glance at the clock, the bee-master went to the
open door and hailed his foreman in from his work about the
garden.&nbsp; Between them they lifted away the heavy caldron
from the fire, and tilted its steaming contents into a barrel
close at hand.&nbsp; The whole building filled at once with a
sweet penetrating odour, which might well have been the
concentrated fragrance of every summer flower on the
countryside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But of all the good things given us by the wise
physician of the hive,&rdquo; quoth the old bee-keeper,
enthusiastically, &ldquo;there is nothing so good as well-brewed
metheglin.&nbsp; This is just as I have made it for forty years,
and as my father made it long before that.&nbsp; Between us we
have been brewing mead for more than a century.&nbsp; It is
almost a lost art now; but here in Sussex there are still a few
antiquated folk who make it, and some, even, who remember the old
methers&mdash;the ancient cups it used to be quaffed from.&nbsp;
As an everyday drink for working-men, wholesome, nourishing,
cheering, there is nothing like it in or out of the
Empire.&rdquo;</p>

86</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
WINTER WORK ON THE BEE-FARM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> light snow covered the path
through the bee-farm, and whitened the roof of every hive.&nbsp;
In the red winter twilight it looked more like a human city than
ever, with its long double rows of miniature houses stretching
away into the dusk on either hand, and its broad central
thoroughfare, where the larger hives crowded shoulder to
shoulder, casting their black shadows over the glimmering
snow.</p>
<p>The bee-master led the way towards the extracting-house at the
end of the garden, as full of his work, seemingly, as ever he had
been in the press of summer days.&nbsp; There was noise enough
going on in the long lighted building ahead of us, but I missed
the droning song of the great extractor itself.</p>

"&ldquo;Hard Times for the Bees&rdquo;"

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we have done with honey work for this year,&rdquo;
said the old bee-man.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is all bottled and cased
long ago, and most of it gone to London.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s
work enough still, as you&rsquo;ll see.&nbsp; The bees get their
long rest in the winter; but, on a big honey-farm, the humans
must work all the year round.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>As we
drew into the zone of light from the windows, many sounds that
from afar had seemed incongruous enough on the silent,
frost-bound evening began to explain themselves.&nbsp; The whole
building was full of busy life.&nbsp; A furnace roared under a
great caldron of smoking syrup, which the foreman was vigorously
stirring.&nbsp; In the far corner an oil engine clanked and
spluttered.&nbsp; A circular saw was screaming through a baulk of
timber, slicing it up into thin planks as a man would turn over
the leaves of a book.&nbsp; Planing machines and hammers and
handsaws innumerable added their voices to the general chorus;
and out of the shining steel jaws of an implement that looked
half printing-press and half clothes-wringer there flowed sheet
after sheet of some glistening golden material, the use of which
I could only dimly guess at.</p>
<p>But I had time only for one swift glance at this mysterious
monster.&nbsp; The bee-master gripped me by the arm and drew me
towards the furnace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is bee-candy,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;winter
food for the hives.&nbsp; We make a lot of it and send it all
over the country.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s ticklish work.&nbsp; When
the syrup comes to the galloping-point it must boil for one
minute, no more and no less.&nbsp; If we boil it too little it
won&rsquo;t set, and if too much it goes hard, and the bees
can&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up his station now, watch in hand, close to the man
who was stirring, while two or three others looked anxiously
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; shouted the bee-master.</p>
<p>The great caldron swung off the stove on its suspending
chain.&nbsp; Near the fire stood a water tank, and into this the
big vessel of boiling syrup was <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>suddenly doused right up to the brim,
the stirrer labouring all the time at the seething grey mass more
furiously than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The quicker we can cool it the better it is,&rdquo;
explained the old bee-keeper, through the steam.&nbsp; He was
peering into the caldron as he spoke, watching the syrup change
from dark clear grey to a dirty white, like half-thawed
snow.&nbsp; Now he gave a sudden signal.&nbsp; A strong rod was
instantly passed through the handles of the caldron.&nbsp; The
vessel was whisked out of its icy bath and borne rapidly
away.&nbsp; Following hard upon its heels, we saw the bearers
halt near some long, low trestle-tables, where hundreds of little
wooden boxes were ranged side by side.&nbsp; Into these the
thick, sludgy syrup was poured as rapidly as possible, until all
were filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each box,&rdquo; said the bee-master, as we watched the
candy gradually setting snow-white in its wooden frames,
&ldquo;each box holds about a pound.&nbsp; The box is put into
the hive upside-down on the top of the comb-frames, just over the
cluster of bees; and the bottom is glazed because then you can
see when the candy is exhausted, and the time has come to put on
another case.&nbsp; What is it made of?&nbsp; Well, every maker
has his own private formula, and mine is a secret like the
rest.&nbsp; But it is sugar, mostly&mdash;cane-sugar.&nbsp;
Beet-sugar will not do; it is injurious to the bees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But candy-making,&rdquo; he went on, as we moved slowly
through the populous building, &ldquo;is by no means the only
winter work on a bee-farm.&nbsp; There are the hives to make for
next season; all those we shall need for ourselves, and hundreds
more we <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>sell in the spring, either empty or stocked with
bees.&nbsp; Then here is the foundation mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to the contrivance I had noticed on my entry.&nbsp;
The thin amber sheets of material, like crinkled glass, were
still flowing out between the rollers.&nbsp; He took a sheet of
it as it fell, and held it up to the light.&nbsp; A fine
hexagonal pattern covered it completely from edge to edge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we call
super-foundation.&nbsp; It is pure refined wax, rolled into
sheets as thin as paper, and milled on both sides with the shapes
of the cells.&nbsp; All combs now are built by the bees on this
artificial foundation; and there is enough wax here, thin as it
is, to make the entire honeycomb.&nbsp; The bees add nothing to
it, but simply knead it and draw it out into a comb two inches
wide; and so all the time needed for wax-making by the bees is
saved just when time is most precious&mdash;during the short
season of the honey-flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took down a sheet from another pile close at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that thin foundation,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;is for section-honey, and will be eaten.&nbsp; But this
you could not eat.&nbsp; This is brood-foundation, made extra
strong to bear the great heat of the lower hive.&nbsp; It is put
into the brood-nest, and the cells reared on it are the cradles
for the young bees.&nbsp; See how dense and brown it is, and how
thick; it is six or seven times as heavy as the other.&nbsp; But
it is all pure wax, though not so refined, and is made in the
same way, serving the same useful, time-saving
purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We moved on towards the store-rooms, out of the clatter of the
machinery.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;It was a great day,&rdquo; he said, reflectively,
&ldquo;a great day for bee-keeping when foundation was
invented.&nbsp; The bee-man who lets his hives work on the old
obsolete natural system nowadays makes a hopeless handicap of
things.&nbsp; Yet the saving of time and bee-labour is not the
only, and is hardly the most important, outcome of the use of
foundation.&nbsp; It has done a great deal more than that, for it
has solved the very weighty problem of how to keep the number of
drones in a hive within reasonable limits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door of a small side-room.&nbsp; From ceiling to
floor the walls were covered with deep racks loaded with frames
of empty comb, all ready for next season.&nbsp; Taking down a
couple of the frames, he brought them out into the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will explain to you what I mean,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;This first one is a natural-built comb, made
without the milled foundation.&nbsp; The centre and upper part,
you see, is covered on both sides with the small cells of the
worker-brood.&nbsp; But all the rest of the frame is filled with
larger cells, and in these only drones are bred.&nbsp; Bees, if
left to themselves, will always rear a great many more drones
than are needed; and as the drones gather no stores but only
consume them in large quantities, a superabundance of the
male-bees in a hive must mean a diminished honey-yield.&nbsp; But
the use of foundation has changed all that.&nbsp; Now look at
this other frame.&nbsp; By filling all brood-frames with
worker-foundation, as has been done here, we compel the bees to
make only small cells, in which the rearing of drones is almost
impossible; and so we keep <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>the whole brood-space in the hive
available for the generation of the working bee alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;are not drones
absolutely necessary in a hive?&nbsp; The population cannot
increase without the male bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good drones are just as important in a bee-garden as
high-mettled, prolific queens,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and
drone-breeding on a small scale must form part of the work on
every modern bee-farm of any size.&nbsp; But my own practice is
to confine the drones to two or three hives only.&nbsp; These are
stationed in different parts of the farm.&nbsp; They are always
selected stocks of the finest and most vigorous strain, and in
them I encourage drone-breeding in every possible way.&nbsp; But
the male bees in all honey-producing hives are limited to a few
hundreds at most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming out into the darkness from the brilliantly-lighted
building, we had gone some way on our homeward road through the
crowded bee-farm before we marked the change that had come over
the sky.&nbsp; Heavy vaporous clouds were slowly driving up from
the west and blotting the stars out one by one.&nbsp; All their
frosty sparkle was gone, and the night air had no longer the keen
tooth of winter in it.&nbsp; The bee-master held up his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I strained my ears to their utmost pitch.&nbsp; A dog barked
forlornly in the distant village.&nbsp; Some night-bird went past
overhead with a faint jangling cry.&nbsp; But the slumbering
bee-city around us was as silent and still as death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have lived among bees for forty <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>years,&rdquo;
said the bee-master, plodding on again, &ldquo;you may get ears
as long as mine.&nbsp; Just reckon it out.&nbsp; The wind has
changed; that curlew knows the warm weather is coming; but the
bees, huddled together in the midst of a double-walled hive,
found it out long ago.&nbsp; Now, there are between three and
four hundred hives here.&nbsp; At a very modest computation,
there must be as many bees crowded together on these few acres of
land as there are people in the whole of London and Brighton
combined.&nbsp; And they are all awake, and talking, and telling
each other that the cold spell is past.&nbsp; That is what I can
hear now, and shall hear&mdash;down in the house yonder&mdash;all
night long.&rdquo;</p>

93</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
THE QUEEN BEE: IN ROMANCE AND REALITY</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Queens</span>?&rdquo; said the
Bee-Master of Warrilow, as he filled his pipe with the blackest
and strongest tobacco I had ever set eyes on;
&ldquo;queens?&nbsp; There are hundreds of hives here, as you can
see; and there isn&rsquo;t a queen in any one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew at the pipe until he had coaxed it into full blast,
and the smoke went drifting idly away through the still April
sunshine.&nbsp; We were in the very midst of the bee-garden,
sitting side by side on the honey-barrow after a long
morning&rsquo;s work among the hives; and the old bee-man had
lapsed into his usual contemplative mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a pretty idea,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;this of royalty, and a realm of dutiful subjects, and all
the rest of it, in bee-life.&nbsp; But experience in apiculture,
as with most things of this world, does away with a good many
fine and fanciful notions.&nbsp; Now, the mother-bee in a hive,
whatever else you might call her, is certainly not a queen, in
the sense of ruling over the other bees in the colony.&nbsp; The
truth is she has little or nothing to do with the direction of
affairs.&nbsp; All the thinking and contriving is done by <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>the
worker-bees.&nbsp; They have the whole management of the hive,
and simply look upon the queen as a much prized and
carefully-guarded piece of egg-laying machinery, to be made the
most of as long as her usefulness lasts, but to be thrown over
and replaced by another the moment her powers begin to
flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there are no queens, properly so called, in
bee-life,&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;All that belongs to
the good old times when there were nothing but straw-skeps, and
&rsquo;twas well-nigh impossible to get at the rights of
anything; so the bee-keeper went on believing that honey was made
out of starshine, and young bees were bred from the juice of
white honeysuckle, which was all pretty enough in its way, even
though it warn&rsquo;t true.&nbsp; But nowadays, when they make
hives with comb-frames that can be lifted out and looked at in
the broad light of day, folk are beginning to understand a power
of things about bees that were dark mysteries only a while
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He puffed at his pipe for a little in silence.&nbsp; Far away
over the great province of hives, the clock on the
extracting-house pointed to half-past twelve; and, true to their
usual time, the home-staying bees&mdash;the housekeepers and
nurses and lately hatched young ones&mdash;were out for their
midday exercise.&nbsp; The foragers were going to and fro as
thickly as ever with their loads of pollen and water for the
still cradled larv&aelig; within; but now round every hive a
little cloud of bees hovered, filling the sunshine with the
drowsy music of their wings.&nbsp; The old bee-man took up his
theme again presently at the point he had broken it off.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;If,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you keep a fairly
close watch on the progress of any one particular hive, from the
time the first eggs appear in the combs early in January,
&rsquo;tis very easy to see how the old false ideas got into
general use.&nbsp; At first glance a bee-colony looks very much
like a kingdom; and the single large bee, that all the others pay
court to and attend so carefully, seems very like a queen.&nbsp;
Then, when you look a little deeper and begin to understand more,
appearances are still all in favour of the old view of
things.&nbsp; The mother-bee seems, on the face of it, a miracle
of intelligence and foresight.&nbsp; While, as far as you know,
all other creatures in the world bring forth their young of both
sexes haphazard, this one can lay male or female eggs apparently
at will.&nbsp; You watch her going from comb to comb, and the
eggs she drops in the small cells hatch out females, and those
she puts in the larger ones are always males, or drones.&nbsp;
More than that: she seems always to know the exact condition of
the hive, and to be able to limit her egg-laying according to its
need, or otherwise, of population; for either you see her filling
only a few cells each day in a little patch of comb that can be
covered with the palm of your hand, or she goes to work on a
gigantic scale, and, in twenty-four hours, produces eggs that
weigh more than twice as much as her whole body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got up now and began pacing to and fro, as was his custom
when much in earnest over his bee-talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to cap all, as the
honey season draws on to its height, you are forced presently to
realise that the queen has conceived and <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>is carrying
through a scheme for the good of her subjects that would do
credit to the wisest ruler ever born in human purple.&nbsp; Every
day of summer sunshine has brought thousands of young bees to
life.&nbsp; The hive is getting overcrowded.&nbsp; Sooner or
later one of two things must happen&mdash;either the increase of
population must be checked, or a great party must be formed to
leave the old home and go out to establish another one.&nbsp;
Then it is that the mother-bee seems to prove beyond a doubt her
wisdom and queenliness.&nbsp; She decides for the emigration; but
as a leader must be found for the party, and none is at hand, she
forms the resolve to head it herself.&nbsp; From that moment a
change comes over the whole hive.&nbsp; Preparation for the
coming event goes on fast and furiously, and excitement increases
day by day.&nbsp; But the queen seems to forget nothing.&nbsp; A
new ruler for the old realm must be provided to take her place
when she is gone for ever; and now you see a party of bees set to
work on something that fairly beggars curiosity.&nbsp; At first
it looks exactly like an acorn-cup in wax hanging from the
under-edge of the comb.&nbsp; Perhaps the next time you look the
cup has grown to twice its original size; and now you see it is
half full of a glistening white jelly.&nbsp; The next time,
maybe, you open the hive, the acorn has been added to the cup;
the queen-cell is sealed over and finished, and about a week
later there comes out a full-grown queen bee, twice the size of
the ordinary worker and quite different in shape and often in
colour too.&nbsp; But days before the new ruler is ready the
excitement in the hive has grown to fever-pitch.&nbsp; If you
come out then in the quiet of the night <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and put your
ear close to the hive, you will hear a shrill piping noise which
the ancient skeppists tell you is the old queen calling her
subjects together for the swarm on the morrow.&nbsp; And, sure
enough, out she goes with half the population of the hive in her
train, to look for a new home; and in a day or so the new queen
comes out of her cell to take charge of the colony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to fill the old briar pipe again, lighting it with
slow deliberate puffs, and I could not help marking how nearly
alike in colour were the bowl and his rugged, sunburnt, clever
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, look you!&rdquo; said he, suddenly levelling
the pipe-stem like a pistol at me to emphasise his words.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the mother-bee really brought all this about, queen
would not be a good enough name for her.&nbsp; But the truth is,
throughout all the wonder-workings of the hive, the queen is
little more than an instrument, a kind of automaton, merely doing
what the workers compel her to do.&nbsp; They are the real queens
in the hive, and the mother-bee is the one and only
subject.&nbsp; Did you ever think what a queen-bee actually is,
and how she comes to be there at all?&nbsp; The fact is that the
workers have made her for their own wise purposes, just as they
make the comb and the honey to store in it.&nbsp; The egg she is
hatched from is in no way different from any worker-egg.&nbsp; If
you take one from a queen-cell and put it in the ordinary comb,
it will hatch out a common female worker-bee: and an egg
transferred from worker-comb to a queen-cell becomes a full-grown
queen.&nbsp; Thousands and thousands of worker-eggs are laid in a
hive during the season, and each of those could be made into <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>a queen if
the workers chose.&nbsp; But the worker-egg is laid into a small
cell, and the larva is bred on a bare minimum of food, at the
least possible cost in time, trouble, and space to the hive;
while, when a new queen is wanted, a cell as big as your
finger-top is built, and the larva is stuffed like a prize-pig
through all its five days of active life, until, with unlimited
food and time and room to grow in, it comes out at last a perfect
mother-bee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I asked him, &ldquo;how is the population
in the hive regulated, and how can the apportionment of the sexes
be brought about?&nbsp; If, as you say, the queen does only what
she is made to do by the workers, and that unthinkingly and
mechanically, you only increase the difficulty of the
problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for increasing or restricting the number of eggs
laid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is only a question of food; and
here you see how the workers control the mother-bee entirely,
and, through her, the whole condition of the hive.&nbsp; When she
is egg-laying they feed her from their own mouths with special
predigested food; and the more she gets of this, the more eggs
are laid.&nbsp; But when the season is done, and the need for a
large population over, this rich stimulating diet is kept from
her.&nbsp; She then must go to the honey-cells like the rest, or
starve; and at once her egg-laying powers begin to fall
off.&nbsp; And it is in exactly the same way&mdash;by their
management of the queen&mdash;that the workers control the
proportion of the sexes in a hive.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis more
difficult to explain, but here is about the rights of it.&nbsp;
Directly the new-hatched queen-bee is ready for work, she flies
out to meet the drones; and one impregnation lasts her whole life
through.&nbsp; But the eggs themselves are <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>not
fertilised until the very moment of laying, and then only in the
case of those laid in worker-comb: drone-eggs are never
impregnated at all.&nbsp; Now, in all likelihood, as the queen is
being driven over the combs, it is the size of the cell that
determines whether the egg laid shall be male or female.&nbsp;
When the queen thrusts her long pointed body into the narrow
worker-cell, her position is a straight, upright one, and the egg
cannot be laid without passing over the impregnation-gland; but
with the larger drone-cell the queen has room to curve herself,
which is the means, I think, of the egg escaping without being
fertilised.&nbsp; And so you see it is only the female bee that
has two parents; the drone has no father at all.&rdquo;</p>

100</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
THE SONG OF THE HIVES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the lane, where it dipped down
between its rose-mantled hedges, nothing of the bee-garden could
be seen.&nbsp; The dense barricade of briar and hawthorn hid all
but the lichened roof of the ancient dwelling-house; and
strangers going by on their way to the village saw nothing of the
crowding hives, and marked little else than the usual busy murmur
of insect-life common to any sunny day in June.</p>
<p>But when they came out of the green tunnel of hedgerows into
the open fields beyond, chance wayfarers always stopped and
looked about them wonderingly, at length fixing a puzzled glance
intently on the blue sky itself.&nbsp; At this corner, and
nowhere else, seemingly, the air was full of a deep, reverberant
music.&nbsp; A steady torrent of rich sound streamed by overhead;
and yet, to the untutored observer, the most diligent scrutiny
failed to reveal its origin.&nbsp; A few gnats harped in the
sunbeams.&nbsp; Now and again a bumble-bee struck a deep chord or
two in the wayside herbage underfoot.&nbsp; But this clear,
strong voice from the skies was altogether unexplainable.&nbsp;
To human sight, at least, the blue <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>air and sunshine held nothing to
account for it; and the stranger unversed in honey-bee lore,
after taking his fill of this melodious mystery, generally ended
by giving up the problem as insoluble, and passing on to his
business or pleasure in the little green-garlanded hamlet under
the hill.</p>
<p>That the bees of a fairly large apiary should produce a
considerable volume of sound in their passage to and fro between
the hives and the honey-pastures is in no way remarkable.&nbsp;
In the heyday of the year&mdash;the brief six weeks&rsquo;
honey-flow of the English summer&mdash;probably each normal
colony of bees would send out an army of foragers at least twenty
thousand strong.&nbsp; What really seems matter for wonder is the
way in which bees appear to concentrate their movements to
certain well-defined tracks in the atmosphere.&nbsp; They do not
distribute themselves broadcast over the intervening space, as
they might be expected to do, but wonderfully keep to certain
definite restricted thoroughfares, no matter how near or how
remote their foraging grounds may be.</p>
<p>And this particular gap in the chain of hedgerows really
marked the great main highway for the bees between the hives and
the clover-fields silvering the whole wide stretch of hill and
dale beyond.&nbsp; Every moment had its winged thousands going
and returning.&nbsp; At any time, if a fine net could have been
cast suddenly a few fathoms upward, it would have fallen to earth
black and heavy with bees; but the singing multitude went by at
so fast and furious a pace that, to the keenest sight, not one of
the eager crew was visible.&nbsp; Only the sound of their going
was plain to all; a mighty tenor note abroad <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>in the
sunshine, a thronging sustained melody that never ceased all
through the heat and burthen of the glittering summer&rsquo;s
day.</p>
<p>When Shelley heard the &ldquo;yellow bees in the
ivy-bloom,&rdquo; and he of Avonside wrote of &ldquo;singing
masons building roofs of gold,&rdquo; probably neither thought of
the humming of the hive-bee as anything more than an ingredient
in the general delightful country chorus, as distinct from the
less-inspiring labour-note of busy humanity in a town.&nbsp; With
the single exception, perhaps, of Wordsworth, poets, thinking
most of their line, commonly miss the subtler phases of wild
life, such as the continually changing emphasis and capricious
variation in bird song, the real sound made by growth, or the
unceasing movement of things conventionally held to be
inert.&nbsp; And in the same way the endlessly varied song of the
bees has been epitomised by imaginative writers generally into a
sound, pleasantly arcadian enough, but little more suggestive of
life and meaning than the hum of telegraph wires in a breeze.</p>
<p>Yet there are few sounds in nature more bewilderingly complex
than this.&nbsp; For every season in the year the song of the
hives has its own distinct appropriate quality, and this, again,
is constantly influenced by the time of day, and even by the
momentary aspect of the weather.&nbsp; A bee-keeper of the old
school&mdash;and he is sure to be the &ldquo;character,&rdquo;
the quaint original of a village&mdash;manages his hives as much
by ear as by sight.&nbsp; The general note of each hive reveals
to him intuitively its progress and condition.&nbsp; He seems to
know what to expect on almost any day in the year, so that if Rip
van Winkle <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>had been an apiarist the nearest bee-garden would have
been as sure a guide to him, in respect of the time of year at
least, as the sun&rsquo;s declining arc in the heaven is to the
tired reapers in respect of the hour of day.</p>
<p>Most people&mdash;and with these must be included even
lifelong country-dwellers&mdash;are wont to regard the humming of
the hive-bee as a simple monotone, produced entirely by the rapid
movement of the wings.&nbsp; But this conception halts very far
short of the actual truth.&nbsp; In reality, the sound made by a
honey-bee is threefold.&nbsp; It can consist either of a single
tone, a combination of two notes, or even a grand triple chord,
heard principally in moments of excitement, such as when a
swarming-party is on the wing, or in late autumn and early
spring, when civil war will often break out in an ill-managed
apiary.&nbsp; The actual buzzing sound is produced by the wings;
the deeper musical tones by the air alternately sucked in and
driven out through the spiracles, which are breathing-tubes
ranged along each side of a bee&rsquo;s body; while the shrill,
clarinet-like note comes from the true voice-apparatus
itself.&nbsp; In ordinary flight it is the wings and the
respiration-tubes conjointly which produce the steady volume of
sound heard as the honey-makers stream over the hedgetop towards
the distant clover-fields; and this is the note also that
pervades the bee-garden through every sunny hour of the
working-day.&nbsp; The rich, soft murmur coming from the
spiracles is probably never heard except when the bee is flying,
but both the true voice and the whirring wing-melody are familiar
as separate sounds to every bee-keeper who studies his hives.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>When
the summer night has shut down warm and still over the red dusk
of evening, and the last airy loiterer is safely home from the
fields, a curious change comes to the bee-garden.&nbsp; The old
analogy between a concourse of hives and a human city is, at this
season, utterly at fault.&nbsp; Silence and rest after the
day&rsquo;s work may be the portion of the larger community, but
in the time of the great honey-flow there is neither rest nor
slumber for the bees.&nbsp; A fury of labour possesses them, one
and all; and darkness does not remit, but merely transposes the
scene of their activity.&nbsp; Coming out into the garden at this
hour for a quiet pipe among the hives&mdash;an old and favourite
habit with most bee-keeping veterans&mdash;the new spirit abroad
is at once manifest.&nbsp; The sulky, fragrant darkness is
silent, quiet with the influence of the starshine overhead; but
the very earth of the footway seems to vibrate with the
imprisoned energy of the hives.&nbsp; This is the time when the
low, rustling roar of wing-music can best be heard, and one of
the most wonderful phases of bee-life studied.&nbsp; The problem
of the ventilation of human hives is attacked commonly on one
main principle&mdash;unstinted ingress for fresh air and a like
abundant means of outward passage for the bad.&nbsp; But, if the
bees are to be credited, modern sanitary scientists are trimming
altogether on the wrong tack.&nbsp; A colony of bees will allow
one aperture, and one alone, in the hive, to serve all and every
purpose.&nbsp; If the enterprising novice in beemanship gimlets a
row of ventilation-holes in the back of his hive&mdash;an idea
that occurs to most tyros in apiculture&mdash;the bees will
infallibly seal them all up again before morning.&nbsp; They work
on entirely different <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>principles, impelled by their
especial needs.&nbsp; The economy of the hive requires the
temperature to be absolutely and immediately within the control
of the bees, and this is only possible when the ventilatory
system is entirely mechanical.&nbsp; The evaporation of moisture
from the new-gathered nectar, and the hatching of the young
brood, necessitate an amount of heat much less than that required
for wax-generating; as soon as the wax-makers begin to cluster
the temperature of the hive is at once increased.&nbsp; But if a
current of air were continually passing through the hive these
necessary heat variations would be difficult to manage, even
supposing them possible at all; so the bees have invented their
unique system of a single passageway, combined with an ingenious
and complicated process of fanning, by which the fresh air is
sucked in at one side of the entrance and the foul air drawn out
at the other, the atmosphere of the hive being thus maintained in
a constant state of circulation, fast or slow, according to the
temperature needed.</p>
<p>In the hot summer weather these fanning-parties are at work
continuously, being relieved by others at intervals of a few
minutes throughout the day.&nbsp; But at night, when the whole
population of the hive is at home, the need for ventilation is
greatly augmented, and then the open lines of fanners often
stretch out over the alighting-board six or seven ranks deep,
making an harmonious uproar that, on a still night, will travel
incredible distances.</p>
<p>This tense, forceful labour-song of the bee-garden, heard
unremittingly throughout the hours of darkness, is always
pleasant, often indescribably soothing in its effect.&nbsp; But
it is essentially a communal note, <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>expressive only of the well or ill
being of the hive at large.&nbsp; The individuality, even
personal idiosyncrasy, which undoubtedly exists among bees, finds
its utterance mainly through the true voice-organ.&nbsp; You
cannot stand for long, here, in the quiet of the summer night,
listening to one particular hive, without sooner or later
becoming aware of other sounds, in addition to the general
musical hubbub of the fanning army.&nbsp; It is evident that a
nervous, high-strung spirit pervades the colony, especially
during the season of the great honey-flow.&nbsp; Their common
agreement on all main issues does not prevent these &ldquo;virgin
daughters of toil&rdquo; from engaging in sundry sharp
altercations and mutual hustlings in the course of their
business; and, at times of threatening weather, a tendency
towards snappishness, and a whimsical perversity
characteristically feminine, seem to make up the prevailing
tone.&nbsp; It is during these chance forays that the true voice
of the honey-bee, apart from the sounds made by wing and
spiracle, can best be differentiated.</p>

107</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
CONCERNING HONEY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bee-keepers in English villages
to-day are all familiar&mdash;too familiar at times&mdash;with
the holiday-making stranger at the garden gate inquiring for
honey.&nbsp; Somehow or other the demand for this old natural
sweet-food appears to have greatly increased of recent years
among wandering townsfolk in the country.&nbsp; A competent
bee-master, dealing with a large number of combs, will not mingle
them indiscriminately, but will unerringly assort them, so that
he will have perhaps at the end of the season almost as many
kinds of honey in store as there are fields on his
countryside.&nbsp; I speak, of course, not of the large
bee-farmer&mdash;who, employing of necessity wholesale methods,
can aim only at a good all-round commercial sample of no finely
distinctive colour or flavour&mdash;but of the connoisseur in
bee-craft, the gourmet among the hives, who knows that there are
as many varieties in honey as there are in wine, and would as
little dream of confusing them.</p>
<p>Honey lovers who have been eating wax all their days will be
as hardly dissuaded from the practice as he whose custom it may
be to consume the paper <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>in which his butter is wrapped, or
take a proportion of the blue sugar-bag with the lumps in his
tea.&nbsp; Yet the last are no more absurdities than the former,
except in degree.&nbsp; Pure beeswax has neither savour nor
nutrient properties, and passes wholly unassimilated through the
human system.&nbsp; Even the bees themselves cannot feed upon it
when at dire extremes: the whole hive may die of starvation in
the midst of waxen plenty.&nbsp; Of all creatures, mice, and the
larva of two species of moth, alone will make away with it; and
even in their case it is doubtful whether the comb be not
destroyed for the sake of the odd grains of pollen and the
pupa-skins it contains.&nbsp; Broadly speaking, unless you can
trust a dipped finger-tip to reveal to you on the moment the
qualities of this village-garden honey, it is always safer to buy
in the comb.&nbsp; But the wax should never be eaten.&nbsp; The
proper way to deal with honeycomb at table is to cut it to the
width of the knife-blade; and, laying it upon the plate with the
cells vertical, press the blade flat upon it, when the honey will
flow out right and left.&nbsp; In this way, if duly carried out,
the honey is scientifically separated, no more than one per cent
remaining in the slab of wax.</p>

</a></p>
<h3><i>The Bee as a Chemist</i></h3>
<p>It is not strange, because it is so common, to find people who
have eaten honeycomb regularly all their lives, yet are
unknowingly ignorant of the first rudimentary fact in its nature
and composition.&nbsp; To know that you do not know is an
intelligible state, the initial true step towards knowledge; but
to be full of erroneous information, and that <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>complacently, is to be ignorant indeed.&nbsp; Of such
are the old lady who dwelt in the Mile End Road, and believed
that cocoanuts were monkeys&rsquo; eggs, and the man who will
tell you without expectancy of contradiction that honey is the
food of bees.</p>
<p>Now this is no essay in cheap paradox, but a sober attempt to
reinstate in the public mind the unsophisticated truth.&nbsp; The
natural foods of the bee-hive are the nectar and the pollen, the
&ldquo;love ferment&rdquo; of the flowers.&nbsp; On these the bee
subsists entirely, so long as she can obtain them, and will go to
her honey stores only when nature&rsquo;s fresh supplies have
failed.&nbsp; One speaks by poetic licence, or looseness, of bees
gathering honey from blossoming plants.&nbsp; The fact is they do
nothing of the kind, and never did.&nbsp; The sweet juices of
clover, heather, and the like, differ fundamentally, both in
appearance and in chemical properties from honey.&nbsp; Though
the main ingredient in honey is nectar, the two are totally
different things; and honey, far from being the normal food of
bees, is only a standby for hard times, a sort of emergency
ration, put up in as little compass and with as great a
concentration as such things can be.</p>
<p>The story of how honey is made, and why it is made at all,
forms one of the most interesting items in the history of the
hive-bee.&nbsp; In a land where nectar-yielding plants flourish
all the year through, if such a spot exist at all, there would be
no honey, because the necessity for it would not occur.&nbsp;
Hive-bees in such a land would go all their lives, and assuredly
never dream of honey-making.&nbsp; But wherever there is winter,
or a season when the supply of nectar and pollen temporarily
fails, the <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>bee, who does not hibernate in the common sense of the
term, must devise a means of supporting life through the famine
period.&nbsp; Many creatures can and do accomplish this by merely
laying up in a comatose condition until such time as their
natural food is plentiful again, and they may safely resume their
old activities.&nbsp; But this will not do for the doughty
honey-bee.&nbsp; A curious aspect of her life is the way in which
she appears to recognise the competitive spirit in all the higher
forms of earthly existence, and deliberately sets herself in the
fore-rank of affairs with that principle in view.&nbsp; It would
be easy for a few hundred worker-bees to get together in some
warm nook underground, with that carefully tended piece of
egg-laying mechanism, their queen, in their midst; and in a
semi-dormant condition to pass the dark winter months through,
gradually rousing their own fires of life as the year warmed up
again in the spring.&nbsp; But such a system would mean that the
colony would have to start afresh from the bottom of the ladder
of progress with every year.&nbsp; The hive-bee has conceived a
better plan, and the basis, the essential factor of it all, is
this thing of mystery which we call honey.</p>
<h3><i>The True Purpose of the Hive</i></h3>
<p>The ancient Roman name for a beehive was <i>alvus</i>, which,
translated into its blunt Anglo-Saxon equivalent, means
belly.&nbsp; And this gives us in a word the whole secret about
honey-making.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, the hive in summer acts
as a digestive chamber, wherein the winter aliment of the stock
is <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>prepared.&nbsp; The bees, during their ordinary
workaday life, subsist on the nectar and pollen which they are
continually bringing into the hive.&nbsp; Much pollen is laid by
in the cells in its raw condition, but pollen is almost
exclusively a tissue-former, and it is not used by the
worker-bees during the winter for their own sustenance, but
preserved until early spring, when it forms the principal
component in the bee-milk on which the larv&aelig; are mainly
fed.&nbsp; The nectar, however, is necessary at all times to
support life in the mature bees, and it must therefore be stored
for use during the long months when there are no flowers to
secrete it.</p>
<p>It is here that we get a glimpse into the ways of the
honey-bee that may well give spur to the most wonder-satiated
amongst us.&nbsp; If a sample of fresh nectar is examined, it
will be found to consist of about seventy per cent of water, the
small remainder of its bulk being made up of what is chemically
known as cane sugar, together with a trace of certain essential
oils and aromatic principles.&nbsp; It is practically nothing but
sweetened and flavoured water.&nbsp; But ripe honey shows a very
different composition.&nbsp; The oils and essences are there,
with some added acids; but of water there is no more than seven
to ten per cent; practically the entire bulk of good honey
consists of sugar, but it is grape sugar, with scarce a trace of
the cane sugar which nectar exclusively contains.&nbsp; To put
the thing in plainest words&mdash;the economic honey-bee, finding
herself with three or four months to get through at the least
possible cost in energy and nutriment, has scientifically
reasoned out the matter, and, among other ingenious provisions,
has arranged to subject <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>her winter food to a process of
pre-digestion during the summer, so that when she consumes it
there shall be neither force expended in its assimilation nor
waste products taken with it, needing to be afterwards
expelled.&nbsp; Honey, in fact, is the nectar digested, and then
regurgitated just when it is ready to be absorbed into the
system.&nbsp; It is almost certain that every drop goes through
this process twice, and possibly three times, in each case by
different bees; and the heat of the hive still further
contributes to the object in view by driving off the superfluous
moisture from the nectar so treated, and thus concentrating it
into an almost perfect food.</p>

113</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
IN THE ABBOT&rsquo;S BEE-GARDEN</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Standing</span> in the lane without, and
looking up at the grey forbidding walls of the old abbey, you
wondered how anything human could exist on the other side; but,
once past the heavy iron-studded gate, your thoughts doubled like
hares in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>It seemed good to be a monk, if life could be all sunshine,
and quietude, and beauty like that.&nbsp; As you waited in the
shadow of the great stone-flagged portico, while your coming was
announced, this feeling grew deeper with every moment.&nbsp; The
garden sloped down to the river&rsquo;s edge, winding footway,
and green lawn, and kitchen-plot all alike girdled and barricaded
with rich-hued autumn flowers.&nbsp; Through the mass of crimson
fuchsia and many-coloured dahlia and hollyhock, bowers of pink
and white geranium with stems as thick as your wrist, ancient
apple-trees drooping under their burden of scarlet fruit,
crowding jungles of roses, you could see the bright waters
sweeping by, and hear their busy sound as they won a way amidst
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>the
rocky boulders strewing the bed of the tortuous Devon stream.</p>
<p>Here and there in the sunny field-of-view visible through the
arched doorway, black-robed figures were quietly at work: some
digging; others gathering apples in the orchard; one sturdy
brother was mowing the Abbot&rsquo;s lawn, the bright blade
coming perilously near his fluttering skirts at every stroke;
another went by trundling a wheelbarrow full of green vegetables
for the refectory table.&nbsp; There was a distant cackle of
poultry, blending oddly with the solemn chant that came from the
chapel hard by.&nbsp; Robins sang everywhere, and starlings
clucked and whistled in the valerian that topped the great
encircling wall.&nbsp; But wherever you looked, whatever drew
away your attention for the moment, you were sure to come back to
the consideration of one preponderant yet inexplicable
thing.&nbsp; A steady, deep note was upon the air.&nbsp; Rich and
resonant, it seemed to come from all directions at once.&nbsp;
The dim, grey-vaulted entrance-porch was full of it.&nbsp;
Looking up into the dusk of oaken beams overhead, there it seemed
at its strangest and loudest.&nbsp; Queerest fact of all, it
appeared to have some mysterious affinity with the sunshine, for
when a stray white argosy of cloud came drifting over the azure
and obscured for a minute the glad light, this full, sonorous
note died suddenly away, rising as swiftly again to its old power
and volume when the sunbeams glowed back once more over the
spacious garden, and over the riverside willows that shed their
gold of dying leafage with every breath of the soft south
wind.</p>
<p>It was not until you stepped outside, and looked <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>upward over
the face of the old building, that you realised what it all
meant.&nbsp; From its foundation to the highest stone of the
ancient bell-turret, the whole front of the place was thickly
mantled with ivy in full flower, and every yellow tuft of blossom
was besieged with bees.&nbsp; There seemed tens of thousands of
them, hovering and humming everywhere; and thousands more
arriving with every moment out of the blue air, or darting off
again fully laden, and away to some invisible bourne over the
ruddy roof of orchard trees.</p>
<p>Intent on this vociferous wonder, you do not catch the
footfall on the gravel-path in your rear, or see the sombre
figure of the Abbot as he comes towards you, the sweep of his
black frock setting all the marigolds nodding behind him, as
though from a sudden flaw of wind.&nbsp; And now you have another
pleasurable disillusionment as to monkish conditions of
being.&nbsp; Trudging along the deep-cut Devonshire lanes on your
way to the Abbey, through the rain of falling autumn leaves, you
pictured the place to yourself as a kind of sacred sink of
desolation, inhabited by a crew of sour-visaged anchorites, who
found only godlessness in sunshine, and in cakes-and-ale nothing
but assured perdition.&nbsp; But here, coming towards you,
smiling, and with outstretched hand, is the last kind of human
being you expected to see.&nbsp; Clad from head to foot in sober
black, with, for ornament, but the one plain silver cross
swinging at his breast, the Abbot shows, unmistakably, for a
gentleman of cultured and enlightened mien.&nbsp; A fine, swarthy
face, kind, calm eyes behind gold spectacles, a voice like an old
violin, and a grip of the hand that <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>makes you wince with its abounding
welcome, all combine to set you there and then at your ease; and
talk begins at once on the old, familiar plane among
bee-keepers&mdash;the quick, enthusiastic interchange, each
participant as ready a listener as learner, common all the world
over, wherever flowers grow and men love bees.</p>
<p>The brothers of the old Benedictine monastery&mdash;so the
Abbot tells you, as he leads the way towards the hives, through
the sun-riddled labyrinth&mdash;have kept bees, probably, for
more than a thousand years.&nbsp; There is no doubt that the
original abbey building stood there, in the wooded cleft of Devon
valley, so long ago as the sixth century, nor little question
that its founder was a bee-man, for he was contemporary and
friend of the great St Modonnoc who himself first taught Irishmen
to keep bees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monks, in the very earliest times, were almost
invariably apiculturists,&rdquo; argues the Abbot.&nbsp; He stops
in the orchard, the more impressively to quote Latin, the glib
leaf-shadows playing the while over his tonsured head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lac et mel; panis, vena rudis.&nbsp; Milk and honey, and
coarse oaten bread.&nbsp; At least we know, from our chronicles,
that these were the common daily fare of our Order more than
eight hundred years ago; and honey remains a part of our food to
this day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus overawed with the centuries, you begin to form a mental
picture of the bee-garden you are about to visit, voyaging so
pleasantly through winding path and shady thicket, with the
bell-like sound of the water growing clearer and clearer at every
step.&nbsp; With all that hoary tradition of the ages <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>behind
them, you promise yourself, these monks will have clung to their
bee-keeping medi&aelig;valism as to some sacred, inviolable
thing.&nbsp; There will be no movable comb-frames, nor American
sections, nor weird, foreign races of bees.&nbsp; They will never
have heard even of foul-brood, or napthol-beta, or the host of
things that bless or curse modern apiculture at every turn of the
way.&nbsp; But, instead, there will be a tangled wilderness of
late blossom, such as only Devonshire can show in November;
dome-shaped hives of straw, each with its singing company about
it; perhaps a superannuated brother or two quietly making straw
hackles to shield the hives against coming winter weather; even,
perchance, the smell of burning brimstone on the air, as the last
remnant of the honey-harvest is gathered in the ancient way, by
&ldquo;taking up&rdquo; the strongest and the weakest colonies of
bees.</p>
<p>And then a wicket-gate in the old wall determines the path and
your ruminations together.&nbsp; A sudden burst of sunshine; the
rich medley of sound from fourscore hives lifting high above the
song of the purling stream; and you are out on the broad, green
river-bank, looking on at a scene very different from the one you
have expected.</p>
<p>There are no old-fashioned hives; they are all of the latest,
most scientific pattern, ranged under the shelter of the wall in
two wide terraces of close-shaven turf, looking southward over
the stream.&nbsp; There are outhouses of the most approved
design, where all the business of a modern apiary is going
on.&nbsp; Here and there you see black-frocked figures at work,
dexterously examining the colonies.&nbsp; There is the deep,
whirring note of honey-extractors; the <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>clamour of
carpenters&rsquo; tools; the faint, sickly smell from the
wax-boilers; all the familiar evidences of bee-farming carried on
in the most modern, twentieth-century way.</p>
<p>As you look down the long, trim avenue of gaily-painted hives
your companion has a quiet side-glance upon you, obviously noting
your disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you?&rdquo; says he, and his deep voice
rings like a passing-bell for all your dreams.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everything must move with the times, or must inevitably
perish.&nbsp; Modernism, rightly understood, is God&rsquo;s
fairest, most priceless gift to the universe.&nbsp; It is a
crucible through which all things of true metal must pass to lose
the accumulated dross of the ages, keeping their original pure
substance, but taking the new shape required of them by
latter-day needs.&nbsp; It is so with the old, dim windows of
man&rsquo;s faith; daily the glass is being taken out, smelted
down, purified, replaced; we can see abroad into distances now
never before visible.&nbsp; And so it must prove even with
bee-keeping, which is one of the oldest human occupations in the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waves his hand towards the sunny prospect before you.&nbsp;
Beyond the river the burning apple-woods soar steadily upward;
and high above these, stretching away to meet the blue sky, lie
the Devon moorlands, once all rose-red with blossoming heather,
but now, parched and brown, except where a grey crag or rock puts
forth its jagged head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a fine thing, perhaps,&rdquo; says the Abbot,
thoughtfully swinging his silver cross in the sunbeams, &ldquo;to
love old, ignorant customs, old, benighted, useless errors, for
their picturesqueness <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>and beauty alone.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t you think it is a still finer thing to teach poor
people how they may win from the common hillside plenty of rich,
nourishing food at almost no cost at all?&nbsp; And that is what
we are doing here.&nbsp; Modern bee-science, it is true, gives us
only an ugly utilitarian hive.&nbsp; It sweeps away all the
bright, iridescent cobwebs in they path of bee-keeping, and
substitutes hard fact for pretty fairy-tale.&nbsp; But the sum of
it all is that the poor cottager gains, not twenty or thirty
pounds at most of coarse, unsaleable sweet food from his hives,
but perhaps hundredweights of pure, choice, section-honey, which,
sold in the proper market, will clothe his children comfortably,
and make it possible for them to lead decent human
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
BEES AND THEIR MASTERS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are three great tokens of the
coming of spring in the country&mdash;the elm-blossom, the cry of
the young lambs, and the first rich song of the awakening
bees.</p>
<p>All three come together about the end of February or beginning
of March, and break into the winter dearth and silence in much
the same sudden, unpremeditated way.&nbsp; You look at the
woodlands, cowering under the lash of the shrill north wind, and
all seems bare and black and lifeless.&nbsp; But the wind dies
down in a fiery sunset.&nbsp; With the darkness comes a warm
breath out of the west.&nbsp; On the morrow the spring sunshine
runs high through all the valleys like liquid gold; the elm-tops
are ablaze with purple; from the lambing-pens far and near a new
cry lifts into the still, warm air; and in the bee-gardens there
is the unwonted, old-remembered symphony, prophetic of the coming
summer days.</p>
<p>The shepherd, the bee-man, the woodlander&mdash;these three
live in the focus of the seasons, and feel their changes long
before any other class of country folk.&nbsp; But the bee-man, if
he would prosper, must take <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the sun as his veritable daily guide
from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Those whose
conception of a bee-keeper is mainly of one who looks on from his
cottage door while his winged thousands work for him, and who has
but to stretch out his hand once a year to gather the hoard he
has had no part in winning, know little of modern
beemanship.&nbsp; This would be almost literally true of the old
skeppist days, when bees were left much to their own devices, and
thirty pounds of indifferent honey was reckoned a good take from
a populous hive.&nbsp; But the modern movable comb-frame has
altered all that.&nbsp; Now ninety or a hundred pounds weight of
honey per hive is expected, with ordinarily good seasons, on a
well-managed bee-farm; and in exceptional honey-flows very strong
stocks of bees have been known to double and even treble that
amount.</p>
<p>The movable comb-frame has three prime uses.&nbsp; The hives
can be opened at any time and their condition ascertained without
having to wait for outside indications.&nbsp; Brood-combs, with
the young bees all ready to hatch out, can be taken from strong
colonies and given to weak ones, and thus the population of all
stocks may be equalised.&nbsp; The filled honeycombs can be
removed, emptied by the centrifugal extractor, and the combs
returned to the hive ready for another charge; and so the most
onerous and exacting labour of the hive, comb-building, is
largely obviated.</p>
<p>The modern beehive has another great advantage over the old
straw skep, in that its size can be regulated according to the
needs of each colony. More combs can be added as the stock grows,
and thus no limit is set to its capacity.&nbsp; With the <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>ancient
form of hive fifteen or twenty thousand bees meant a crowded
citadel, and there was nothing for it but to relieve the
congestion by swarming.&nbsp; But the swarming habit has always
been the principal obstacle to large honey-takes; and the problem
which the modern bee-keeper has to solve is how to prevent his
stocks from thus breaking themselves up into several hopelessly
weak detachments.</p>
<p>It is all a war of wits between the bees and their
masters.&nbsp; In nature the honey-bee is possessed of an
inveterate caution.&nbsp; Famine is especially dreaded, and the
number of mouths to fill in a hive is always kept strictly to the
limits of the incoming food-supply.&nbsp; Thus a natural
bee-colony is seldom ready for the honey-flow when it begins in
early April, because it is only then that the raising of the
young brood is allowed its fullest scope.&nbsp; This, however, is
of no importance as far as the bees themselves are concerned, for
a balance of stores of about twenty pounds weight at the end of a
season will safely carry the most populous colony through any
ordinary winter.</p>
<p>But from the bee-master&rsquo;s point of view it means
practically a lost harvest.&nbsp; All the arts and devices of the
modern bee-keeper, therefore, are set to work to overcome this
timid conservatism of the hives, and to induce the creation of
immense colonies of worker-bees as early as possible in the
season, so that there may be no lack of labourers when the
harvest is ready.</p>
<p>These first warm days of March, that bring the elm-blossom,
and the cry of the lambs, and the old sweet music of the
bee-gardens together, really <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>form the most critical time of all
for the apiarist who depends on his honey for his
bread-and-butter.&nbsp; It is the natural beginning of the
bee-year, and on his skill as a craftsman from now onward all
chance of a prosperous season will rest.&nbsp; It is true that,
within the hive, the bees have been awake and stirring for a long
time past.&nbsp; Ever since the &ldquo;turn of the days,&rdquo;
just before Christmas, the queen-mother has been busy; and now
there are young bees, little grey fluffy creatures, everywhere in
the throng; and the area of sealed brood-cells is steadily
growing.&nbsp; But it is only now that the world out-of-doors
becomes of any interest to the bees.</p>
<p>This is the time when the scientific bee-man must get to
work.&nbsp; His whole policy is one of benevolent fraud.&nbsp; He
knows that the population in his hives will not be allowed to
increase until there is a steady, assured income of nectar and
pollen.&nbsp; He cannot create an early flower-crop, but he does
almost the same thing.&nbsp; Every hive is supplied with a
feeding-stage, where cane-sugar syrup, of nearly the same
consistency as the natural flower-secretion, is administered
constantly; and he places trays full of pea-flour at different
stations amongst his hives, as a substitute for pollen.&nbsp;
There is a special art in the administration of this
sugar-syrup.&nbsp; One might think that if the bees required
feeding at all, the more they were given the better they would
thrive.&nbsp; But experience is all against this notion.&nbsp;
The artificial food is given, not to replenish an exhausted
larder, but to simulate a natural new supply.&nbsp; This, in the
ordinary state of things, would begin in about a month&rsquo;s
time, coming at first scantily, and gradually increasing.&nbsp;
By syrup-feeding early in March, the <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>bee-master sets the clock of the
year forward by many weeks.&nbsp; He imitates nature by arranging
his feeding-stages so that the supply of syrup can be limited to
the actual day-to-day wants of the colony, allowing the bees
freer access to the syrup-bottles from time to time as their
numbers augment.</p>
<p>If this is adroitly done, the effect on the colony is
remarkable.&nbsp; The little company of bees whose part it is to
direct the actions of the queen-mother, seeing what is apparently
the natural fresh supply of food coming in, in daily increasing
quantities, at length cast their hereditary reserve aside, and
allow the queen fullest scope for egg-laying.&nbsp; The result is
that by the time the real honey-flow commences the population of
each hive is double what it would be if it had been left to its
own resources, and the honey-yield is more than proportionately
great.&nbsp; It is well know among bee-men that a hive
containing, say, forty thousand workers will produce very much
more honey than two hives together numbering twenty thousand
each.</p>
<p>There is another vital consideration in this work of early
stimulation of the hives, which the capable bee-master will never
neglect.&nbsp; When the natural honey-glut is on, the whole hive
reeks with the odours given off from the evaporating
nectar.&nbsp; The raw material, as gathered from the flowers,
must be reduced by the heat of the hive and other agencies to
about one-quarter of its original bulk before it is changed into
mature honey.&nbsp; The artificial food given to the bees will,
of course, have none of this scent, and the old honey-stores in
the hive are hermetically sealed under their waxen
cappings.&nbsp; To complete the deception which has been so
elaborately <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>contrived, the bee-master must furnish his hives with a
new atmosphere.&nbsp; This he does by slicing off the cappings
from some of the old store-combs, thus letting out their
imprisoned fragrance, and filling the hive at once with the very
essence of the clover-fields where the bees worked in the bygone
summer days.&nbsp; The smell of the honey at this time, combined
with the regular and increasing supply of syrup, acts like a
powerful stimulant on the whole stock, and the work of
brood-raising goes rapidly forward.</p>
<p>In intensive culture of all kinds there are risks to be run
peculiar to the artificial state of things engendered, and modern
bee-breeding is no exception to the rule.&nbsp; When once this
fictile prosperity is installed by the bee-master, no lapse or
variation in the due amount of food must occur.&nbsp; Even a
single day&rsquo;s remission of supplies may undo all that a
month&rsquo;s careful manipulation has brought about.&nbsp;
English bees understand their native climate only too well, and
the bitter experience of former years has taught them to be
prepared for a return of hard weather at any moment.&nbsp; Under
natural conditions, if a few weeks&rsquo; warmth has induced them
to raise population, and a sudden return of cold ensues, the bees
will take very prompt and stern measures to meet the threatening
calamity of starvation.&nbsp; The queen will cease laying at
once; all unhatched brood will be ruthlessly torn from its
cradle-cells and destroyed; old, useless bees will be expelled
from the colony.&nbsp; And this is exactly what will happen if
the artificial food-supply is allowed to fail even for the
shortest period.</p>

THE HONEY THIEVES</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> the bee-garden lay, under its
sheltering crest of pine-wood, the April sunbeams seemed to
gather, as water gathers in the lap of enclosing hills.&nbsp; Out
in the lane the sweet hot wind sang in the hedgerows, and the
white dust lifted under every footfall and went bowling merrily
away on the breeze.&nbsp; But once among the crowding hives, you
were launched on a still calm lake of sunshine, where the
daffodils hardly swayed on their slender stems; and the smoke
from the bee-master&rsquo;s pipe, as he came down the red-tiled
path, hung in the air behind him like blue gossamer spread to
catch the flying bees.</p>
<p>As usual, the old bee-man had an unexpected answer ready to
the most obvious question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will the new honey begin to come in?&rdquo; he
said, repeating my inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, the truth is honey
never comes into the hives at all; it only goes out.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the old mistake people are always falling
into.&nbsp; Good bees never gather honey: they leave that to the
wicked ones.&nbsp; If I had a hive of bees that took to
honey-gathering, I should have to <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>stop them, or end them
altogether.&nbsp; It would have to be either kill or
cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a quiet whiff or two, enjoying the effect of this
seeming paradox, then went on to explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the bees gather from the flowers,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;is no more honey than barley and hops are beer.&nbsp;
Honey has to be manufactured, first in the body of the bee, and
then in the comb-cells.&nbsp; It must stand to brew in the heat
of the hive, just as the wort stands in the gyle-tun; and when it
is ready to be bunged down, before the bee adds the last little
plate of wax to the cell-capping, she turns herself about and, as
I believe, injects a drop of the poison from her sting&mdash;or
seems to do so.&nbsp; Then it is real honey, but not
before.&nbsp; Now, about these bad bees, the
honey-gatherers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, putting his hand suddenly to his face.&nbsp; A bee
had unexpectedly fastened her sting into his cheek.&nbsp; At the
same moment another came at me like a spent shot from a gun, and
struck home on my own face.&nbsp; The old bee-man took a hurried
survey of his hives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as luck, or ill-luck, will
have it, I think I can show you the honey-gatherers at work
now.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only one thing that would make my bees
wild on such a morning as this; and we must find out where the
trouble is, and stop it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was looking about him in every direction as he spoke; and
at last, on the farther side of the bee-garden, seemed to make
out something amiss.&nbsp; As we passed between the long rows of
bee-dwellings every hive was the centre of its own thronging busy
life.&nbsp; From each there was a steady stream of foragers
setting outward into the brilliant <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>sunshine, and as constant a current
homeward, as the bees returned heavily weighed down under loads
of golden pollen from the willows by the neighbouring
riverside.&nbsp; But round the hive, near which the bee-master
presently came to a halt, there was a very different scene
enacting.&nbsp; The deep, rich note of labour was replaced by an
angry hubbub of war.&nbsp; The alighting-board of the hive was
covered with fighting bees; company launched against company;
single combats to the death; writhing masses of bees locked
together and tumbling furiously to the ground in every
direction.&nbsp; The soil about the hive was already thickly
strewn with the dead and dying: and the air, for yards round, was
filled with the piercing note of the fray.&nbsp; It seemed as
hopeless to attempt to stop the carnage as it was manifestly
perilous to go near.</p>
<p>But the bee-master had his own short way with this, as with
most other difficulties.&nbsp; He took up a big watering-can and
filled it hastily from the butt close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This hive is a weak stock,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;and it is being robbed by one of the stronger ones.&nbsp;
That is always the danger in spring.&nbsp; We must try to drive
the robbers home, and only one thing will do it.&nbsp; That is, a
heavy rainstorm; and as there is no chance of getting the real
thing, we must make one for ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode into the thick of the flying bees, and raising the
can above his head, sent a steady cascade of water over the whole
hive.&nbsp; The effect was instantaneous.&nbsp; The fighting
ceased at once.&nbsp; The marauding bees rose on the wing and
streamed away homeward.&nbsp; Those belonging to the attacked <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>hive
scrambled into its friendly shelter, a bedraggled, sodden
crew.&nbsp; When at length all was quiet, the old bee-man fetched
an armful of hay and heaped it up before the hive, completely
covering its entire front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the robbers come back,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
will stop them going in, while the bees inside can crawl to and
fro if they wish.&nbsp; But at sunset we must do away with the
stock altogether by uniting it to another colony, and so put
temptation out of the robbers&rsquo; way.&nbsp; And now we must
go and look for the robbers&rsquo; den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He refilled his pipe, and led the way down the long
thoroughfare of the bee-city, examining every hive in turn as he
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is trouble of this kind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that
does more than anything else to upset the instinct-theory of the
old-fashioned naturalists, at least as far as the honey-bee is
concerned.&nbsp; Why should a whole houseful of them suddenly
break away from their old orderly industrious habits, and take to
thieving and violence?&nbsp; But so it often happens.&nbsp; There
is character, or the want of it, among bees just as there is in
the human race.&nbsp; Some are gentle and others vicious; some
are hard workers early and late, and others seem to take things
easily, or to be subject to unaccountable moods and
caprices.&nbsp; Then the weather has an extraordinary influence
on the temper of most hives.&nbsp; On sunny, calm days, when the
glass is &lsquo;set fair,&rsquo; and the clover in full bloom,
the bees will take no notice of any interference.&nbsp; The hives
can be opened and manipulated without the slightest fear of a
sting.&nbsp; But if the glass is falling, or the wind rising and
backing, the <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>bees will be often as spiteful as cats, and as timid as
squirrels.&nbsp; And there are times, just before a storm, when
to touch some hives would mean bringing the whole population out
upon you like a nest of hornets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped by one of the hives, and laid his great sunburnt
hand down flat on the entrance-board.&nbsp; The bees took no
account of the obstacle, but ran to and fro over his fingers with
perfect unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are bees that
follow none of these general rules.&nbsp; Here is a stock which
it is almost impossible to ruffle.&nbsp; You may turn their home
inside out, and they will go on working just as if nothing had
happened.&nbsp; They are famous honey-makers, while they keep to
it; but, like all mild-tempered bees, they are too fond of
swarming, and have to be put back into the hive two or three
times before they settle down to the season&rsquo;s
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he talked, he was looking about him carefully, and at last
made a short cut towards a hive standing a little apart from the
rest.&nbsp; The bees of this hive were behaving in a very
different fashion from those we had just inspected.&nbsp; They
were running about the flight-board in an agitated way, and the
whole hive gave out a note of deep unrest.&nbsp; The old bee-man
puffed his &ldquo;smoker&rdquo; up into full draught, and set to
work to open the hive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the honey thieves,&rdquo; he said, as he
pulled off the coverings of the hive and laid bare its rumbling,
seething interior to the searching sunlight, &ldquo;and when once
bees have taken to robbing their neighbours there is only one way
to cure them.&nbsp; You must exterminate the whole brood.&nbsp;
In the old <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>days, a stock of bees with confirmed bad habits would
be taken to the sulphur-pit and settled at once for good and
all.&nbsp; But modern bee-keepers have a better and less wasteful
way.&nbsp; Now, look out for the queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was lifting out the comb-frames one by one, and subjecting
them to a close examination.&nbsp; At last, on one of the most
crowded frames, he spied the huge full-bodied queen, and lifted
her off by the wings.&nbsp; Then he closed the hive up again as
expeditiously as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, as he ground the discredited
monarch under his heel, &ldquo;we have stopped the mischief at
the fountain-head.&nbsp; Of course, if we left the bees to raise
another queen for themselves, she would be of the same blood as
the first one, and her children would inherit the same
undesirable traits.&nbsp; But to-morrow, when the bees are
thoroughly sobered and frightened at the loss of their ruler, we
will give them another full-grown fertile queen of the best blood
in the apiary.&nbsp; In three weeks&rsquo; time the new
population will begin to take over the citadel; and in a month or
two all the old bees will have died off, and with them the last
of the robber taint.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
THE STORY OF THE SWARM</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> professional breeders of the
honey-bee have succeeded in producing the much-desired
non-swarming race, and swarming has become a thing of the past,
naturalists of the old &ldquo;instinct&rdquo; school will be able
to turn their backs on at least one very inconvenient
question.</p>
<p>There is no denying that the breeders are theoretically right
in their present efforts.&nbsp; The swarming-habit in the
honey-bee is admittedly the main obstacle to large honey-takes;
and now that two of the principal objects of swarming&mdash;the
multiplication of stocks and renewal of queens&mdash;are fairly
well understood, and can be artificially effected, there is no
doubt that the universal adoption of a non-swarming strain
throughout the bee-farms of the country, if such a thing were
possible, would result in a very greatly increased honey-yield,
and the people would get cheap honey.&nbsp; But at present it is
not easy to see that any progress whatever in this direction has
been made.&nbsp; The bees continue to swarm, in spite of
beautifully adjusted theories; and the old attempt to fit the
square peg of instinct <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>into the round hole of fact goes on
as merrily as ever.</p>
<p>Students of bee-life, approaching the matter unencumbered by
ancient postulates, find themselves face to face with many
surprising things, which would seem unexplainable on any other
hypothesis than that the bees are endowed with reason, and that
of no mean order.</p>
<p>Instinct implies invariability, a dead perfection of motive
working blindly against all odds of circumstance, and always
succeeding in the main.&nbsp; But the very essence of reason,
humanly speaking, is its imperfection and continual deviation
both in motive and performance.&nbsp; Watching a swarm of bees
from the moment of its issue from the hive, the first thing that
strikes the unacademic observer is that most of the bees seem to
have no notion at all as to what the furore is about.&nbsp; They
are by no means the obedient items of a common inexorable
purpose.&nbsp; They are more like a crowd of people running in a
street, all agog with excitement and curiosity, but not one of
them knowing the cause of the general stampede.&nbsp; Sometimes a
stock of bees will give visible sign of the approach of a
swarming-fit for several days before the swarm actually
issues.&nbsp; But, as often as not, no such manifestation is
given.&nbsp; The hive, at least to the unexpert eye, seems in its
normal condition right up to the moment when the great emigration
takes place.&nbsp; And then, as at a given signal, the work
suddenly stops, and the bees pour out of the hive-entrance in a
living stream, darkening the air for many yards round, the cloud
of darting bees rising higher and higher, and spreading over a
greater space with every <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>moment.&nbsp; The swarm may take
three or four minutes to get fairly on the wing; and, from a
populous hive, may number twenty-five or thirty thousand
individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p134.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;Hiving a swarm&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;Hiving a swarm&rdquo;"
 src="images/p134.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>There is seldom any fear of stings at such a time, and this
extraordinary phase of bee-life may usually be studied at close
quarters.&nbsp; One of the most puzzling things about it is that,
however large the swarm proves to be, enough workers and drones
are still left behind in the old hive to carry on the work of the
stock.&nbsp; When the order for the sally is given, and a
feverish excitement spreads at once throughout the hive, those
bees chosen to remain in the old dwelling are perfectly unmoved
by the general mad spirit.&nbsp; Directly the last of the
trekking-party has gone off, the home-bees set diligently and
quietly to work as if nothing had happened.&nbsp; With the whole
garden alive with flashing wings, and resounding with the rich
deep hubbub of the swarm, the bees forming the remnant of the old
colony go about their usual business in perfect unconcern,
lancing straight off into the sunshine towards the clover-fields,
or winging busily homeward laden with honey and pollen, just as
they have been doing for weeks past.&nbsp; And if the hive be
opened at this time, it will show nothing unusual except that no
queen will be found.&nbsp; There will be three or four
queen-cells like elongated acorns hanging from the edges of the
central combs; and the first queen to hatch out, and prove
herself happily mated, will be allowed to destroy all the
others.&nbsp; For the rest, work seems to be going on in a
perfectly normal way.&nbsp; The nectar and pollen are being
stored in the cells; the young grubs are <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>being fed;
most of the combs are fairly well covered with their busy
population, consisting principally of young bees, although a fair
sprinkling of mature workers and drones is everywhere
visible.&nbsp; In eight or ten days the new queen will be laying
and the colony rapidly regaining its former strength.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the swarm is still in the air, every bee careering
hither and thither with no other apparent purpose than that of
allowing full vent to the mad excitement which has so
mysteriously seized upon it.&nbsp; This state will often last a
considerable time, and, in rare cases, will end by the bees
trooping soberly back to the hive under just as mysterious a
revulsion of feeling and resuming their old steady work.&nbsp; At
other times the cloud of bees will suddenly rise high into the
air and go straight off across country, disappearing in a few
moments from the keenest view.&nbsp; But generally, after a short
spell of this berserk frolic, the swarm seems gradually to unite
under common direction.&nbsp; The dark network of flying bees
overhead shrinks and grows denser.&nbsp; At last you make out the
beginnings of the cluster&mdash;a mere handful of bees clinging
to a branch in a tree or bush.&nbsp; The handful swells at a
wonderful pace as the bees crowd towards it from all
quarters.&nbsp; In three or four minutes the whole multitude is
locked together in a solid pendent mass, and the wild song of
freedom has died down to a few stray intermittent notes.</p>
<p>This silence, following the shrill, abounding turmoil, has an
almost uncanny effect.&nbsp; It seems so utterly opposed to, and
incongruous with, the mad state of things that existed before;
and it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the bees have
weakly <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>given way to an incontrollable impulse against all
their principles and inherited traditions of right, and that now,
hanging thoroughly sobered and shamed and disillusioned, homeless
and beggared, they realise themselves face to face with the
unforeseen consequences of their thoughtless act.&nbsp; It is
just the conduct which might be expected of some savage human
race, pent up for long years in the rigid bounds of an alien
civilisation, which in one blind moment has thrown to the four
winds all its irksome blessings, only to realise, when the first
glowing hour of freedom is over, that their long captivity has
made the old wild life no longer possible in fact.&nbsp; Some
such period of deep despondency as has come to the silent swarm
in the hedgerow can be imagined as inevitably falling on such a
race of men.&nbsp; But if the conquerors were to follow the
absconding tribe into the lean wilderness and bring them home
again repentant, restoring them to their old shelter and plenty
once more, probably they would vent their satisfaction in a
chorus of joyful approval.&nbsp; And it is just this which seems
to be happening when the swarm is shaken down in front of a new,
well-furnished hive.&nbsp; The first bees that find their way
into the cool dark interior set up a jubilant hum unlike any
other sound known in beecraft.&nbsp; At once the strain is taken
up by all the rest, and the whole multitude marches into the new
home to a tune which the least fanciful must concede is nothing
but sheer satisfaction melodised.</p>
<p>There is little in all this which suggests a race of creatures
bound within the hard and fast laws of an implanted instinct,
which it is neither in their power nor their pleasure to
override.&nbsp; It is true that in the <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>natural
life of the honey-bee this annually recurrent impulse of swarming
serves several necessary ends; but the utilitarian argument,
however stretched, cannot be made to explain the whole
fact.&nbsp; There is unmistakably an element of caprice about
it&mdash;a kicking over the traces&mdash;which would be natural
enough in creatures possessed of reason, but totally
inconceivable from any other point of view.&nbsp; And the farther
we look into the whole problem the more perplexing it
seems.&nbsp; If we grant that the issue of a swarm, from a hive
overcrowded and headed by a queen past her prime, is a necessity,
why is it that the same hive will often swarm a second and even a
third time until the stock is practically extinguished and the
original object of swarming wholly defeated?&nbsp; Or if, under
the same conditions, a hive prepares to swarm and cold windy
weather intervenes, how is it that frequently all idea of
swarming is abandoned for the season, although apparently the
necessity for it continues to exist?</p>
<p>Creatures which pursue a certain line of conduct under the
blind promptings of instinct could hardly be credited with
intelligence enough to lead them to seek another means for the
desired end when the preordained means has failed.&nbsp; But this
is just what the honey-bee appears to do in at least one
instance.&nbsp; If the mother-bee of a colony is getting past her
work, and she cannot be sent off with a swarm in the usual way,
the bees will supersede her.&nbsp; They will deliberately put her
to death, and raise another queen to take her place.&nbsp; This
State execution of the old worn-out queens is one of the most
curious and pathetic things in or out of bee-life.&nbsp; One
probe with a sting would suffice in the matter; but the <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>honey-bee
is a great stickler for the proprieties.&nbsp; The royal victim
must be allowed to meet her fate in a royal way; and she is
killed by caresses, tight-locked in the joint embrace of the
executioners until suffocation brings about her death.</p>
<h2><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
THE MIND IN THE HIVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Students</span> of the ways of the
honey-bee find many things to marvel at, but little to excite
their wonder more than the unique system of ventilation
established in the hive.</p>
<p>Under natural conditions it is a moot point whether bees
concern themselves at all with the ventilation of their
nests.&nbsp; Wild bees usually fix upon a site for their dwelling
where there is ample space for all possible developments; and the
ventilation of the home&mdash;as with most human
tenements&mdash;is left pretty much to chance causes.&nbsp; At
least, in the course of many years&rsquo; observation, the writer
has never seen the fanners at work in the entrance of a natural
bee-settlement.</p>
<p>Probably this remarkable fanning system originated in a new
want felt by the bees, when, in remote ages, their domestication
began, and they found themselves cooped up in impervious hives
which, in their very earliest form, were possibly roughly-plaited
baskets, daubed over with clay, or earthen pots baked dry in the
sun.&nbsp; This form, originally adopted by the bee-keeper as a
protection <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>against honey-thieves of all sorts, as well as against
the weather, brought about a new order of things in
bee-life.&nbsp; The free circulation of air which would obtain
when the bee-colony was established naturally in a cleft of a
rock or in a hollow tree became no longer possible.&nbsp; And
so&mdash;as they have been proved to have done in many modern
instances&mdash;the bees set to work to evolve new methods to
meet new necessities, and the present ventilation-system
gradually became an established habit of the race.</p>
<p>Watching a hive of bees on any hot summer&rsquo;s day, one
very curious, not to say startling, fact must strike the most
superficial observer.&nbsp; If the fanning bees were stationed
round the flight-hole in a merely casual, irregular way, their
obvious employment would be surprising enough.&nbsp; But it is at
once seen that each fanner forms part in an ingenious and
carefully thought-out plan.&nbsp; Outwardly, the fanners are
arranged in regular rows, one behind the other, all with their
heads pointed towards the hive, and all working their wings so
fast that their incessant movement becomes nearly
invisible.&nbsp; These rows of bees extend sometimes for several
inches over the alighting-board, and on very hot days there may
be as many as seven or eight ranks.&nbsp; The ventilating army
never covers the whole available space.&nbsp; It is always at one
side or the other; or, where the entrance is a wide one, it may
be divided into two wings, leaving a centre space free.&nbsp; The
fanning bees, moreover, do not keep close together, but stand in
open order, so that the continual coming and going of the
nectar-gatherers is in no wise impeded.&nbsp; There is a <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>constant
flow of worker-bees through the ranks in both directions; yet the
fanning goes on uninterruptedly, and, under certain conditions,
the current of air thus set up may be strong enough to blow out
the flame of a candle held at the edge of the flight-board.</p>
<p>In all study of the ways of the honey-bee, the safer plan is
to begin with the assumption that a reasoning creature is under
observation, and then to work back to the surer, well-beaten
tracks of thought concerning the lower creation&mdash;that is, if
the observed facts warrant it.&nbsp; But this question of the
ventilation of the modern beehive&mdash;only one of many other
problems equally astounding&mdash;helps the orthodox naturalist
of the old school very little on his comfortable way.&nbsp; We
know that the wild bee generally chooses a situation for her nest
which is neither cramped nor confined, but has in most cases
ample space available for the future growth of the colony.&nbsp;
Security from storm or flood seems to be the first
consideration.&nbsp; The fact that the interior of a bee-nest is
more or less in darkness appears to be mainly accidental.&nbsp;
Bees have no particular liking for absolute darkness, nor, in
fact, is any hive perfectly free from light.&nbsp; Experiment
will prove that a very small aperture is sufficient to admit a
considerable amount of reflected and diffused light, quite enough
for the needs of the hive.&nbsp; It may be supposed, therefore,
that the bees would have no objection to building in broad
daylight, or even sunlight, if, in conjunction with the first
necessities of shelter, security, and equable temperature, such a
location were easily obtainable under natural conditions.&nbsp;
It would only be another instance of <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>their unique adaptability to
circumstances forced upon them.</p>
<p>In the matter of ventilation, however, they seem to make a
very determined and highly successful stand against imposed
conditions.&nbsp; Bee-keeping cannot be made a profitable
occupation unless the work of the bees is kept strictly within
certain sharply-defined limits, and probably the modern movable
comb hive is the best means to this end.&nbsp; That it leaves the
necessity of ventilation wholly unprovided for is not the fault
of the bee-master, but of the bees themselves.&nbsp; They refuse
pointblank to have anything to do with human notions of
hygiene.&nbsp; Many devices have been tried, in the form of
vent-shafts and the like, to carry off the vitiated air of the
hive, but all have failed, because the bees insist on stopping up
every crack or crevice left in walls, roof, or floor.&nbsp; For
some inscrutable reason they will have only the one opening,
which must serve for all purposes, and the hive-maker has had to
learn by hard-won experience that the bees are right.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in any attempt to follow the reasoning of the bees in
this matter, it is well first of all to get rid of the word
&ldquo;fanning&rdquo; altogether.&nbsp; The wing-action of the
ventilating bees is more that of a screw-propeller than a
fan.&nbsp; The air is not beaten to and fro, as a fan would beat
it, but is driven backwards, and thus the ventilating squadron on
the flight-board really sets up an exhaust-current, which draws
the contaminated air out of the hive.&nbsp; This implies an
equally strong current of fresh air passing into the hive, and
explains why the bees work at the side of the entrance only, the
central, <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>unoccupied space being obviously the course of the
intake.&nbsp; Thus the bees&rsquo; system of ventilation can be
described as a swiftly-flowing loop of air, having both
extremities outside the hive, much as a rope moves over a pulley,
and it can be readily understood that any supplementary inlet or
outlet&mdash;such as the bee-master would instal, if he were
permitted&mdash;would be rather a hindrance to the system than a
help.&nbsp; Probably the actual main current keeps to the walls
of the hive throughout, the ventilation between the brood-combs
being more slowly effected.&nbsp; This would fulfil a double
purpose.&nbsp; The air supplied to the central portion, or
brood-nest proper, would be thoroughly warmed before it reached
the young larva, while the outer and upper combs, where the
stores of new honey are maturing, would lie in the full
stream.</p>
<p>It must be remembered that a constant supply of fresh air of
the right temperature is as necessary for the brewing honey as it
is for the bees and young brood.&nbsp; The nectar, as gathered
from the flowers, needs to be deprived of the greater part of its
moisture before it becomes honey.&nbsp; Thus, in the course of
the season, many gallons of water must pass out of the hive in
the form of vapour, and the removal of this water constitutes an
important part of the work of the ventilating army.&nbsp; Here,
again, the wisdom of the bees in insisting on a mechanical, as
opposed to an automatic, system of air-renewal, becomes
evident.&nbsp; If the warm, moisture-laden air were left to
discharge itself from the hive by its own buoyancy, condensation
of this moisture would take place on the cooler surfaces of the
hive-walls, and the lower regions of the hive would speedily <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>become a
quagmire.&nbsp; But by setting up a mechanically-driven current
the air is drawn out before condensation can take place, and
thus, in one operation, forming a veritable triumph in economics,
the hive interior is rendered both dry and salutary, while its
temperature is sustained at the necessary hatching-point for the
young brood.</p>
<p>A reflection which will occur to most thinking minds is, why
should the domesticated honey-bee be constrained to resort to all
these devices, when the wild bee seems to lead a happy-go-lucky
existence, comparatively free, so far as we know, from such
complicated cares?&nbsp; The answer to this is that the science
of apiculture has wrought a change in the bees&rsquo; normal
environment which is probably without parallel in the whole
history of the domestication of the lower creatures.&nbsp; In a
modern hive the honey-bee lives on a vastly elaborated scale, and
the ancient rules of bee-life are no longer applicable.&nbsp;
Much the same sort of thing has happened as in the case of a
village which has grown to a city.&nbsp; It is useless to deal
with the new order of things as a mere question of
arithmetic.&nbsp; Abnormal growth in a community involves change
not only in scale but in principle; and it is the same with a
hive of bees as with a hive of men.</p>

THE KING&rsquo;S BEE-MASTER</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Students</span> of old books on the
honey-bee&mdash;and perhaps there has been more written about
bees during the last two thousand years than of all other
creatures put together&mdash;do not quite know what to make of
Moses Rusden, who was Charles the Second&rsquo;s bee-master, and
wrote his &ldquo;Further Discovery of Bees&rdquo; in the year
1679.&nbsp; The wonder about Rusden is that obviously he knew so
much that was true about bee-life, and yet seems, of set purpose,
to have imparted so little.&nbsp; He was a shrewdly observant
man, of lifelong experience in his craft.&nbsp; His system of
bee-keeping would not have disgraced many an apiculturist of the
present time, often yielding him a honey harvest averaging sixty
pounds to the hive, which is a result not always achieved even by
our foremost apiarian scientists.&nbsp; His hives were fitted
with glass windows, through which he was continually studying his
bees.&nbsp; He must have had endless opportunities of proving the
fallacy and folly of the ancient classic notions as to
bee-life.&nbsp; And yet we find him <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>gravely upholding almost the entire
framework of fantastic error, old even in Pliny&rsquo;s time; and
speaking of the king-bee with his generals, captains, and
retinue, honey that was a dew divinely sent down from heaven, the
miraculous propagation of bee-kind from the flowers, and all the
other curious myths and fables handed down from writer to writer
since the very earliest days.</p>
<p>But, reading on in the little time-stained, worm-eaten book,
it is not very difficult to guess at last why Rusden adopted this
attitude.&nbsp; He was the King&rsquo;s bee-master, and therefore
a courtier first and a naturalist afterwards.&nbsp; In the first
flush of the Restoration, anyone who had anything to say in
support of the divine right of kings was certain to catch the
Royal eye.&nbsp; Rusden admits himself conversant with
Butler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Feminine Monarchie,&rdquo; published some
fifty years before, in which the writer argues that the single
great bee in a hive was really a female.&nbsp; To a man of
Rusden&rsquo;s practical experience and deductive quality of
mind, this statement must have lead, and no doubt did lead, to
all sorts of speculations and discoveries.&nbsp; But with a ruler
of Charles the Second&rsquo;s temperament, feminine monarchies
were not to be thought of.&nbsp; Rusden saw at once his
restrictions and his peculiar opportunity, and wrote his book on
bees, which is really an ingenious attempt to show that the
system of a self-ruling commonwealth is a violation of nature,
and that, whether for bees or men, government under a king is the
divinely ordained state.</p>
<p>Whether, however, Rusden was deliberately insincere, or
actually succeeded in blinding himself <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>conveniently for his own purposes, it must be admitted
not only that he argued the case with singular adroitness, but
that never did facts adapt themselves so readily to either
conscious or unconscious misrepresentation.&nbsp; In the
glass-windowed hives of the Royal bee-house at Saint
James&rsquo;s, he was able to show the King a nation of creatures
evidently united under a common rule, labouring together in
harmony and producing works little short of miraculous to the
medi&aelig;val eye.&nbsp; He saw that these creatures were of two
sorts, each going about its duty after its kind, but that in each
colony there was one bee, and only one, which differed entirely
from the rest.&nbsp; To this single large bee all the others paid
the greatest deference.&nbsp; It was cared for and nourished, and
attended assiduously in its progress over the combs.&nbsp; All
the humanly approved tokens of royalty were manifest about
it.&nbsp; No wonder the King&rsquo;s bee-master was not slow in
recognising that, in those troublous times, he could do his
patron no greater service than by pointing out to the
superstitious and ignorant multitude&mdash;still looking askance
at the restored monarchy&mdash;such indisputable evidence in
nature of Charles&rsquo;s parallel right.</p>
<p>And perhaps nature has never been at such pains to conceal her
true processes from the vulgar eye as in this case of the
honey-bee.&nbsp; If Rusden ever suspected that the one large bee
in each colony was really the mother of all the rest, and had set
himself to prove it, he would have found the whole array of
visible facts in opposition to him.&nbsp; If ever a truth seemed
established beyond all reasonable doubt, it <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>was that
the ordinary male-and-female principle, pertaining throughout the
rest of creation, was abrogated in the single instance of the
honey-bee.&nbsp; The ancients explained this anomaly as a special
gift from the gods, and the bees were supposed to discover the
germs of bee-life in certain kinds of flowers and to bring them
home to the cells for development.&nbsp; Rusden improved upon
this idea by assigning to his king-bee the duty of fertilising
these embryos when they were placed in the cells, for he could
not otherwise explain a fact of which he was perfectly well
aware&mdash;that the large bee travelled the combs unceasingly,
thrusting its body into each cell in turn.&nbsp; Rusden also held
that the worker-bees were females, but only&mdash;as Freemasons
would say&mdash;in a speculative manner.&nbsp; They neither laid
eggs nor bore young.&nbsp; Their maternal duties consisted only
in gathering the essence of bee-life from the blossoms and
nursing and tending the young bees when they emerged from their
cradle-cells.&nbsp; The drones were a great difficulty to
Rusden.&nbsp; To admit them to be males&mdash;as some held even
in his day&mdash;would have been against the declared object of
his book, as tending to entrench upon royal prerogatives.&nbsp;
Luckily, this truth was as easy of apparent refutation as all the
rest.&nbsp; No one had ever detected any traffic of the sexes
amongst bees either in or out of the hives; nor, indeed, is such
detection possible.&nbsp; The fact that the queen-bee has
concourse with the drone only once in her whole life, and that
their meeting takes place in the upper air far out of reach of
human observation, is knowledge only of yesterday.&nbsp; In
Rusden&rsquo;s time such a <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>marvel was never even
suspected.&nbsp; As the drones, therefore, were never seen to
approach the worker bees or to notice them in any way, and as
also young bees were bred in the hives during many months when no
drones existed at all, Rusden&rsquo;s ingenuity was equal to the
task of bringing them into line with his theory.</p>
<p>If he had lived a few decades earlier, and it had been
Cromwell, instead of the heartless, middle-aged rake of a
sovereign, whom he had to propitiate, no doubt Rusden would have
asked his public to swallow Pliny&rsquo;s whole apiarian
philosophy at a gulp.&nbsp; Bee-life would then have been held up
as a foreshadowing of celestial conditions, and the facts would
have lent themselves to this view equally as well.&nbsp; But his
task was to represent the economy of the hive as a clear proof of
divine authority in kingship, and it must be conceded that, as
far as knowledge went in those days, he established his case.</p>
<p>His book was published under the &aelig;gis of the Royal
Society, and &ldquo;by his Majestie&rsquo;s especial
Command,&rdquo; which was less a testimony of the King&rsquo;s
love for natural history than of his political astuteness.&nbsp;
Apart, however, from its peculiar mission, the book is
interesting as a sidelight on the old bee-masters and their
ways.&nbsp; Probably it represents very fairly the extent of
knowledge at the time, which had evidently advanced very little
since the days of Virgil.&nbsp; Rusden taught, with the ancients,
that honey was a secretion from the stars, and that wax was
gathered from the flowers, as well as the generative matter
before mentioned.&nbsp; He had <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>one theory which seems to have been
essentially his own.&nbsp; The little lumps of many-coloured
pollen, which the worker-bees fetch home so industriously in the
breeding season, he held to be the actual substance of the young
bees to come, in an elementary state.&nbsp; These, he tells us,
were placed in the cells, having absorbed the feminine virtues
from their bearers on the way.&nbsp; The king-bee then visited
each in turn, vivifying them with his essence, after which they
had nothing to do but grow into perfect bees.&nbsp; He got over
the difficulty of the varying sexes of the bees bred in a hive by
asserting that these lumps of animable matter were created in the
flowers, either female, or neuter&mdash;as he called the
drones&mdash;or royal, as the case might be.&nbsp; Having denied
the drones any part in the production of their species, or in
furnishing the needs of the hive, Rusden was hard put to it to
find a use for them in a system where it would have been
<i>l&egrave;se-majest&eacute;</i> to suppose anything superfluous
or amiss.&nbsp; He therefore hits upon an idea which, curiously
enough, embodies matter still under dispute at the present time,
although it is being slowly recognised as a truth.&nbsp; Rusden
says the use of the drones is to take the place of the other bees
in the hive when these are mostly away honey-gathering.&nbsp;
Their great bodies act as so many warming stoves, supplying the
necessary heat to the hatching embryos and the maturing stores of
honey.&nbsp; It is well known that drones gather together side by
side, principally in the remoter parts of the hive, often
completely covering these outer combs.&nbsp; They seldom rouse
from their lethargy of repletion to <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>take their daily flight until about
midday, when most of the ingathering work is over, and the hive
is again fairly populous with worker-bees.&nbsp; Probably,
therefore, Rusden was quite right in his theory, which, hundreds
of years after, is only just beginning to be accepted as a
fact.</p>

POLLEN AND THE BEE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Popular</span> beliefs as to the ways of
the honey-bee, unlike those relating to many other insects, are
surprisingly accurate, so far as they go.&nbsp; But, dealing with
such a complex thing as hive-life, it is well-nigh impossible to
have understanding on any single point without going very much
farther than the ordinary tabloid-method of knowledge can carry
us.&nbsp; This is especially true with regard to pollen, and the
uses to which it is put within the hive.&nbsp; The hand-books on
bee-keeping usually tell us that pollen is employed with honey as
food for the young bees when in the larval state; but this is so
wide a generalisation that it amounts to almost positive
error.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p152.jpg">

"&ldquo;A rarity in hive life: a honeycomb built upward&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;A rarity in hive life: a honeycomb built upward&rdquo;"
 src="images/p152.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the pollen in its raw condition is given
only to the drone-larva, and this only towards the end of its
life as a grub.&nbsp; For the first three days of the
drone-larva&rsquo;s existence, and in the case of the young
worker-bee for the whole five days of the larval period, the
pollen is administered by the nurse-bees in a pre-digested
state.&nbsp; After partial assimilation, both the pollen and the
nectar are regurgitated by these nurse-bees, <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and form
together a pearly-white fluid&mdash;veritable bee-milk&mdash;on
which the young grubs thrive in an extraordinary way.</p>
<p>There are few things more fascinating than to watch a hive of
bees at work on a fine June morning, and to note how the pollen
is carried in.&nbsp; With a prosperous stock, thousands of bees
must pass within the space of a few minutes, each bee dragging
behind her a double load of this substance.&nbsp; Very often, in
addition to the half-globes of pollen which she carries on her
thighs, the bee will be smothered in it from head to foot, as in
gold-dust.&nbsp; If you track her into the hive, one curious
point will be noted.&nbsp; No matter how fast she may go, or what
frantic spirit of labour may possess the entire colony, the
pollen-laden bee is never in a hurry to get rid of her
load.&nbsp; She will waste precious time wandering over the
crowded combs, continually shaking herself, as though showing off
her finery to her admiring relatives; and it may be some minutes
before she finally selects a half-filled pollen-cell and proceeds
to kick off her load.&nbsp; The different kinds of pollen are
packed into the cells indiscriminately, the bee using her head as
a ram to press each pellet home.&nbsp; When the cell is full it
is never sealed over with a waxen capping, as in the case of the
honey-stores, but is left open or covered with a thin film of
honey, apparently to preserve it from the air.&nbsp; The
nurse-bees, who are the young workers under a fortnight old, help
themselves from these pollen-bins.&nbsp; They also frequently
stop a pollen-bearer as she hurries through the crowd, and nibble
the pollen from her thighs.</p>
<p>Throughout the season there is hardly an <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>imaginable
colour or shade of colour which is not represented in the pollen
carried into a beehive; and with the aid of a microscope it is
not difficult to identify the source of each kind.&nbsp; In May,
before the great field-crops have come into bloom, the pollen is
almost entirely gathered from wild flowers, and consists of
various rich shades of yellow and brown.&nbsp; By far the
heaviest burdens at this time are obtained from the
dandelion.&nbsp; The pollen from this flower is a peculiarly
bright orange, and is easily recognised under a strong glass by
its grains, which are in the form of regular dodecahedrons,
thickly covered all over with short spikes.</p>
<p>It is well known that the honey-bee confines herself during
each journey to one species of flower, and this is proved by the
microscope.&nbsp; It is not easy to intercept a homing bee laden
with pollen.&nbsp; On alighting before the hive she runs in so
quickly that the keenest eye and deftest hand are necessary to
effect her capture.&nbsp; But with the aid of a miniature
butterfly-net and a little practice it can generally be done; and
then the pellet of pollen will be found to consist almost
invariably of one kind of grain.&nbsp; But it is not always
so.&nbsp; The honey-bee, as a reasoning creature, does not and
cannot be expected to do anything invariably.&nbsp; Among some
hundreds of these pollen-lumps examined under the microscope I
have occasionally found grains of pollen differing from the
bulk.&nbsp; Perhaps there are no two species of flower which have
pollen-grains exactly alike in colour, shape, and size, and in
most the differences are very striking.&nbsp; In the cases
mentioned the bulk of the pollen was made up of long oval yellow
grains divided lengthwise into <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>three lobes or gores, which were
easily identifiable as coming from the figwort.&nbsp; The
isolated grains were very minute spheres thickly studded with
blunt spikes&mdash;obviously from the daisy.&nbsp; The figwort is
a famous source of bee-provender in spring time, and its pollen
can be seen flowing into the hives at that time in an almost
unbroken stream of brilliant chrome-yellow.&nbsp; The
brownish-gold masses that are also being constantly carried in
are from the willow; and where the hives are near woodlands the
bluebells yield the bees enormous quantities of pollen of a dull
yellowish white.</p>
<p>It is interesting that all these various materials, so
carefully kept asunder when gathered, are for the most part
inextricably mingled within the hive.&nbsp; Obviously the system
of visiting only one species of flower on each foraging journey
can have no relation to pollen-gathering; nor does it seem to
apply to the nectar obtained at the same time.&nbsp; It cannot be
inferred that the contents of each honey-cell are brewed from
only one source, because it has been proved that bees do blend
the various nectars together when several crops are
simultaneously in flower.&nbsp; A honey-judge can easily detect
the flavours of heather and white-clover in the same sample of
honey by taste alone.&nbsp; But there is another and much more
conclusive way of deciding the source from which a particular
sample of honey has been obtained.&nbsp; In the purest and most
mature honeys there are always a few accidental grains of pollen,
invisible to the eye, yet easily detected under a strong
glass.&nbsp; And these may be taken as almost infallible guides
to the species of flowers visited by the foraging bees.&nbsp; The
only explanation which <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>seems possible, therefore, of the
honey-bee&rsquo;s care to visit only one kind of blossom on each
journey is that it is done for the sake of the plant itself,
cross-fertilisation being thus rendered extremely improbable.</p>
<p>When once the bee-man has succumbed to the fascination of the
microscope, there is very little chance that he will ever return
to his old panoramic view of things.&nbsp; He goes on from wonder
to wonder, and the horizon of the new world he has entered
continually broadens with each marvelling step.&nbsp; To the old
rule-of-thumb bee-keepers pollen was mere bee-bread; and the fact
that the bees preferred one kind to another did not greatly
concern them.&nbsp; But at a time when the small-holder is
beginning to feel his feet, and the question of the feasibility
of planting for bee-forage is certain to arise, it is necessary
to know why bees gather this important part of their diet from
particular kinds of flowers, while leaving severely alone others
which appear to be equally attractive.&nbsp; To this question the
microscope supplies a sufficient answer.</p>
<p>Chemists have determined that nectar is the heat and
force-producer in the food of the bee, while pollen supplies its
nitrogenous tissue-building qualities.&nbsp; It is evident that
bees select certain pollens for their superior nutritive powers,
just as in bread-making we prefer wheat to any other species of
grain.&nbsp; In the kinds of pollen most in favour with bees a
good microscope will reveal the fact that the pollen-grains are
often accompanied by a certain amount of true farina, as well as
essential oils, which must greatly enhance their
food-value.&nbsp; And in those crops generally neglected by <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>bees, such
as daisies and buttercups, those accompaniments appear to be
absent.&nbsp; The dandelion is especially rich in a thick yellow
oil, which the bees carry away with the pollen; while two plants
in particular of which the bees are especially fond&mdash;the
crocus and the box&mdash;have a large amount of this farina
mingled with the true pollen.</p>
<p>It is only within the last century or so that the real uses of
pollen in the economy of the hive have been ascertained.&nbsp;
Until comparatively recent times the pollen was supposed to be
crude wax, which the bees refined and purified into the white
ductile material of the new combs; and a few old-fashioned
bee-keepers still hold this view, and refuse to believe that the
wax used in comb-building is entirely a secretion from the
bee&rsquo;s own body.&nbsp; Pollen, indeed, seems to have very
little to do with wax, hardly any nitrogenous food being consumed
while the wax is being generated.</p>

158</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
THE HONEY-FLOW</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Warrilow Bee-Farm, where it lay
under the green lip of the Sussex Downs, there was always food
for wonder, whether the year was at its ebb or its flow.&nbsp;
But in July of a good season the busy life of the farm reached a
culminating point.</p>
<p>The ordinary man, in search of excitement, distraction, the
heady wine served out only to those who stand in the
fighting-line of the world, would hardly seek these things in a
little sleepy village sunk fathoms deep in English summer
greenery.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, with the coming of the great
honey-flow to Warrilow came all these subtle human
necessities.&nbsp; If you would keep up with the bee-master and
his men at this stirring time, you must be ready for a break-neck
gallop from dawn to dusk of the working day, and often a working
night to follow.&nbsp; While the honey-flow endured, muscles and
nerves were tried to their breaking-point.&nbsp; It was a race
between the great centrifugal honey-extractor and the toiling
millions of the hives; and time and again, in exceptionally
favourable seasons, the bees <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>would win; the honey-chambers would
clog with the interminable sweets, and the dreaded atrophy of
contentment would seize upon the best of the hives, with the
result that they would gather no more honey.</p>
<p>A week of hot bright days and warm still nights, with here and
there a gentle shower to hearten the fields of clover and
sainfoin; and then the fight between the bee-master and his
millions would begin in earnest.&nbsp; There would be no more
quiet pipes, strolling and talking among the hives: the
Bee-Master of Warrilow was a general now, with all a great
commander&rsquo;s stern absorption in the conduct of a difficult
campaign.&nbsp; Often, with the first grey of the summer&rsquo;s
morning, you would hear his footsteps on the red-tiled path of
the garden below, as he hurried off to the bee-farm, and
presently the bell in the little turret over the extracting-house
would clang out a reveille to his men, and draw them from their
beds in the neighbouring village to another day of work, perhaps
the most trying work by which men win their bread.</p>
<p>It is nothing in the ordinary way to lift a super-chamber
weighing twenty pounds or so.&nbsp; But to lift it by
imperceptible degrees, place an empty rack in its place, return
the full rack to the hive as an upper story, and to do it all so
quietly and gently that the bees have not realised the onslaught
on their home until the operation is complete, is quite another
thing.&nbsp; And a long day of this wary, delicate handling of
heavy weights, at arm&rsquo;s length, under broiling sunshine, is
one of the most nerve-wearing and back-breaking experiences in
the world.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>One
of the mistakes made by the unknowing in bee-craft is that the
bee-veil is never used among professional men.&nbsp; But the
truth is that even the oldest, most experienced hand is glad
enough, at times, to fall back behind this, his last line of
defence.&nbsp; All depends upon the momentary temper of the
bees.&nbsp; There are times when every hive on the farm is as
gentle as a flock of sheep, and it is possible to take any
liberty with them.&nbsp; At other times, and apparently under
much the same conditions, stocks of bees with the steadiest of
reputations will resent the slightest interference, while the
mere approach to others may mean a furious attack.&nbsp; No true
bee-man is afraid of the wickedest bees that ever flew, but it is
only the novice who will disdain necessary precautions.&nbsp;
Even the Bee-Master of Warrilow was seldom seen without a wisp of
black net round the crown of his ancient hat, ready to be let
down at a moment&rsquo;s notice if the bees showed any
inclination to sting.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In a long vista of memorable days spent at Warrilow, one
stands out clear above all the rest.&nbsp; It was in July of a
famous honey-year.&nbsp; The hay had long been carried, and the
second crops of sainfoin and Dutch clover were making their
bravest show of blossom in the fields.&nbsp; It was a stifling
day of naked light and heat, with a fierce wind abroad hotter
even than the sunshine.&nbsp; The deep blue of the sky came right
down to the earth-line.&nbsp; The farthest hills were hard and
bright under the universal glare.&nbsp; And on the bee-farm, as I
came through the gap in the dusty hedgerow, I saw that every man
had his veil close drawn down.&nbsp; The bee-master hailed me
from his crowded corner.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;are just to the nick!&rdquo; he called,
in his broadest Sussex.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis stripping-day
wi&rsquo; us, an&rsquo; I can do wi&rsquo; a dozen o&rsquo;
ye!&nbsp; Get on your veil, d&rsquo;rectly-minute, an&rsquo; wire
in t&rsquo;ot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fierce hot wind surged through the little city of hives,
scattering the bees like chaff in all directions, and rousing in
them a wild-cat fury.&nbsp; Overhead the sunny air was full of
bees, striving out and home; and from every hive there came a
shrill note, a tremulous, high-pitched roar of work,
half-baffled, driven through against all odds and hindrances, a
note that bore in upon you an irresistible sense of fear.&nbsp; I
pulled on the bee-veil without more ado.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stripping-day&rdquo; was always the hardest day of the
year at Warrilow.&nbsp; It meant that some infallible sign of the
approaching end of the harvest had been observed, and that all
extractable honey must be immediately removed from the
hives.&nbsp; A change of weather was brewing, as the nearness of
the hills foretold.&nbsp; There might be weeks of flood and
tempest coming, when the hives could not be opened.&nbsp;
Overnight there had been a ringed moon, and the morning broke hot
and boisterous, with an ominous clearness everywhere.&nbsp; By
midday the glass was tumbling down.&nbsp; The bee-master took one
look at it, then called all hands together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Strip!&rdquo; he said laconically; and all work in
extracting-house and packing-sheds was abandoned, and every man
braced himself to the job.</p>
<p>The hives were arranged in long double rows, back to back,
with a footway between wide enough to allow the passage of the
honey barrow.&nbsp; This was not unlike a baker&rsquo;s
hand-cart, and contained <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>empty combs, which were to be
exchanged for the full combs from the hives.&nbsp; I found myself
sharing a row with the bee-master, and already infused with the
glowing, static energy for which he was renowned.&nbsp; The
process of stripping the hives varied little with each colony,
but the bees themselves furnished variety enough and to
spare.&nbsp; In working for comb-honey, the racks or sections are
tiered up one above the other until as many as five stories may
be built over a good stock.&nbsp; But where the honey is to be
extracted from the comb another system is followed.&nbsp; There
is then only one super-chamber, holding ten frames side by side,
and these frames are removed separately as fast as the bees fill
and seal them, their place being taken by the empty combs
extracted the day before.</p>
<p>The whole art of this work consists in disturbing the bees as
little as possible.&nbsp; At ordinary times the roof of the hive
is removed, the &ldquo;quilts&rdquo; which cover the comb-frames
are then very gently peeled away, and the frames with their
adhering bees are placed side by side in the clearing-box.&nbsp;
The honey-chamber is then furnished with empty combs, and the
coverings and roof replaced.&nbsp; On nine days out of ten this
can be done without a veil or any subduing contrivance; and the
bees which were shut up with the honey in the clearing-box will
soon come out through the traps in the lid and fly back to their
hives.&nbsp; But when time presses, and several hundred hives
must be gone through in a few hours, a different system is
adopted.&nbsp; Speed is now a main desideratum in the work, and
on stripping-day at Warrilow resort is made to a contrivance
seldom seen there at other times.&nbsp; This <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>is simply a
square of cloth saturated with weak carbolic acid, the most
detested, loathsome thing in bee-comity.&nbsp; Directly the
comb-frames are laid bare these cloths are drawn over them, and
in a few moments every bee has crowded down terror-stricken into
the lower regions of the hive, leaving the honey-chamber free for
instant and swift manipulation.</p>

SUMMER LIFE IN A BEE-HIVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you go to the bee-garden early
of a fine summer&rsquo;s morning you will be struck by the
singular quiet of the place.&nbsp; All the woods and hedgerows
are ringing with busy life.&nbsp; The rooks are cawing homeward
with already hours of strenuous work behind them.&nbsp; The
cattle in the meadows are well through their first cud.&nbsp; But
as yet the bee-city is as still as the sleeping village around
it.&nbsp; Now and again a bee drops down from the sky on a
deserted hive-threshold with sleepy hum, and runs past the guards
at the gate.&nbsp; But these are bees that have wandered too far
afield overnight, tempted by the sunny warmth of the
evening.&nbsp; The dusk has caught them, and obliterated their
flying-marks.&nbsp; They have perforce camped out under some
broad leaf, to be wakened by the earliest light of morning and
hurry home with their belated loads.</p>
<p>The sun is well up over the hillbrow before the visible life
of the bee-garden begins to rouse in earnest.&nbsp; The
water-seekers are the first to appear.&nbsp; <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>Every hive
has its traditional dipping-place, generally the oozy margin of
some neighbouring pond, where the house-martins have been
wheeling and crying since the first grey of dawn.&nbsp; Now the
bees&rsquo; clear undertone begins to mingle with the chippering
chorus.&nbsp; In a little while there is a thin straight line of
humming music stretched between the hives and the pond: it could
not be straighter if a surveyor had made it with his level.&nbsp;
Again a little while, and this long searchlight of melody thrown
out by the bee-garden veers to the north.&nbsp; You may track it
straight over copse and meadow, seeing not a bee overhead, but
guided unerringly by the arrow-flight of music, until, on the far
hillside, it is lost in a perfect roar of sound.&nbsp; Here the
white-clover is in almost full blossom again: in southern England
at least it is always the second crop of clover that yields the
most plentiful harvest to the hives.</p>
<p>It must be a disturbing thing to those kindergarten moralists
who hold the bee up to youth for an example of industry and
prudence to learn that she is by no means an early riser; though,
at this time of year, she is undoubtedly both wealthy and
wise.&nbsp; For it is her very wisdom that now makes her a
lie-abed.&nbsp; When the iron is hot, she will not be slow in
striking.&nbsp; But it is nectar, not dewdrops, from which she
makes her honey.&nbsp; Very wisely she waits until the sun has
drunk up the dew from the clover-bells, and then she hurries
forth to garner their undiluted sweets.&nbsp; Even then, perhaps,
three-fourths of her burden will be carried uselessly.&nbsp; In
the brewing-vats of the hive the nectar must stand and steam
until three parts of its original <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>bulk has evaporated, and its sugar
has been inverted into grape-sugar.&nbsp; Then it is honey, but
not before.&nbsp; When we see the fanning-army at work by the
entrance of a hive, it is not alone an undoubted passion for pure
air that moves the bees to such ingenious activity.&nbsp; In the
height of the honey season many pints of vaporised liquid must be
given off by the maturing stores in the course of a day and
night, and all this water must be got rid of.&nbsp; Herein is
shown the wisdom of the bee-master who makes the walls of his
hives of a material that is a bad conductor of heat.&nbsp; It is
a first necessity of health to the bees that the moisture in the
air, which they are incessantly fanning out at this time, should
not condense until it is safely wafted from the hive.&nbsp; A
cold-walled hive can easily become a quagmire.</p>
<p>The bee-garden is quiet now in the sweet virgin light of the
summer&rsquo;s morning; but the thought of it as containing so
many houses of sleep, true of the village with its thatched human
dwellings, could not well be farther from the truth in regard to
the village of hives.&nbsp; There is little sleep in a bee-hive
in summer.&nbsp; Of any common period of rest, of any quiet night
when all but the sentinels at the gate are slumbering, of any
general time of relaxation, there is absolutely none.&nbsp; Each
individual bee&mdash;forager or nurse, comb-builder or
storekeeper&mdash;works until she can work no more, and then
stops by the way, or crawls into the nearest empty cell for a
brief siesta.&nbsp; But the life of the hive itself never halts,
never wavers in summertime, night or day.&nbsp; Go to it morning,
noon, or night in the hot July season, and you will always <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>find it
driving onward unremittingly.&nbsp; The crowd is surging to and
fro.&nbsp; There is ever the busy deep labour-note.&nbsp; Its
people are building, brewing, wax-making, scavenging,
wet-nursing, being born and dying: it is all going on without
pause or break inside those four reverberating walls, while you
stand without in the dew-soaked grass and level sunbeams
wondering how it is that all the world can be at full flood-tide
of merry life and music while these mysterious hive people give
scarce a sign.</p>
<p>It is at night chiefly that the combs are built.&nbsp; The
wax, that is a secretion from the bees&rsquo; own bodies, will
generate only under great heat, and the temperature of the hive
is naturally greatest when all the family is at home.&nbsp; In
the night also such works as transferring a large mass of honey
from one comb to another are undertaken.&nbsp; It is curious to
note that at night time the drones get together in the remotest
parts of the hive, apparently to keep up the heat in these
distant quarters, which are away from the main cluster of
worker-bees.&nbsp; There is hardly another thing in creation,
perhaps, with a worse name than the drone-bee.&nbsp; But like all
bad things he is not so bad as he is represented.&nbsp; Apart
from his main and obvious use, the drone fulfils at least one
very important office.&nbsp; His habit is not to leave his snug
corner until close upon midday.&nbsp; Thus, when every
able-bodied worker bee is out foraging, the temperature of the
hive is sustained by the presence of the drones, and the young
bee-brood is in no danger of chilling.</p>
<p>Though the supreme direction of all affairs in a <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>bee-hive
falls to the lot of the worker-bees, the queen-mother is second
to none in industry.&nbsp; At this time of year she goes about
her task with a dogged patience and assiduity pathetic to
witness.&nbsp; She may have to supply from two thousand to three
thousand brood-cells with eggs in the course of a single day, and
she is for ever wandering through the crowded corridors of the
hive looking for empty cradles.&nbsp; The old bee-masters
believed that the queen was always accompanied in these unending
promenades by exactly a dozen bees, whom they called the Twelve
Apostles.&nbsp; It is true that whenever the queen stops in her
march she is immediately surrounded by a number of bees, who form
themselves into a ring, keeping their heads ceremoniously towards
her.&nbsp; But close observation reveals the fact that the
queen-bee is never followed about by a permanent retinue.&nbsp;
When she moves to go on, the ring breaks and disperses before
her; but the bees who gather round her on her next halt are those
who happen to occupy the space of comb she has then reached.</p>
<p>The truth seems to be that she is passed from &ldquo;hand to
hand&rdquo; over the combs of the brood-nest, and is stopped
wherever a cell requires replenishing.&nbsp; Each bee that she
encounters on her path turns front and touches her gently with
her antenna.&nbsp; The queen constantly returns these salutes as
she moves, and it looks exactly as if she were going the rounds
of her domain and collecting information.&nbsp; Often she is
stopped by half a dozen bees in a solid phalanx, and carefully
headed off in a new direction.&nbsp; She looks into every cell as
she goes, and when she has lowered her body into a cell, the
Apostles <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>instantly gather about her, with strokings and
caresses.&nbsp; But their number is seldom twelve.&nbsp; It
varies according to the bulk and length of the queen herself, and
is more often sixteen than a dozen.</p>

THE YELLOW PERIL IN HIVELAND</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the hedgerow that surrounds the
bee-garden the wrens and robins have been singing all the morning
long.&nbsp; Still a few pale sulphur buds remain on the
evening-primroses.&nbsp; The balsams make a glowing patch of
magenta by the garden gate.&nbsp; Over the door porch of the old
thatched cottage purple clematis climbs bravely; and the
nasturtiums still flaunt their scarlet and gold in the sunny
angle of the wall.&nbsp; But, for all the colour and the music,
the hot sun, and the serene blue air overhead, you can never
forget that it is October.&nbsp; If the towering elm-trees by the
lane-side showed no fretting of amber in their greenery, nor the
beeches sent down their steady rain of russet, there would still
be one indubitable mark of the season&mdash;the voice of the
hives themselves.</p>
<p>Rich and wavering and low in the sweet autumn sunlight, it
comes over to you now with the very spirit of rest in every
halting tone.&nbsp; There is work, of a kind, doing in the
bee-garden.&nbsp; A steady tide of bees is stemming out from and
home to every hive.&nbsp; But there is none of the press and busy
<a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>clamour
of bygone summer days.&nbsp; It is only a make-believe of
duty.&nbsp; Each bee, as she swings up into the sunshine, hovers
a while before setting easy sail for the ivy in the lane; and, on
returning, she may bask for whole minutes together on the hot
hive-roof.&nbsp; There is no sort of hurry; little as there may
be to do abroad, there is less at home.</p>
<p>But to one section of the bee-community, these slack October
hours bring no cessation of toil.&nbsp; The guards at the gate
must redouble their vigilance.&nbsp; Cut off from most of their
natural supplies, the yellow pirates&mdash;the wasps&mdash;are
continually prowling about the entrance; and, in these lean
times, will dare all dangers for a fill of honey.&nbsp; Incessant
fierce skirmishes take place on the alighting-board.&nbsp; The
guards hurl themselves at each adventuress in turn.&nbsp; The
wasp, calculating coward that she is, invariably declines battle,
and makes off; but only to return a little later, hoping for the
unwary moment that is sure to come.&nbsp; While the whole
strength of the picket is engaged with other would-be pilferers,
she slips round the scuffling crew, and plunges into the fragrant
gloom of the hive.</p>
<p>The variation in temperament among the members of a bee-colony
is never better illustrated than by the way in which these
marauders are received and dealt with.&nbsp; The wasp never tries
to pick a way to the honey-stores through the close packed ranks
of the bees.&nbsp; She keeps to the sides of the hive, and works
her way up by a series of quick darts whenever a path opens
before her.&nbsp; Evidently her plan is to avoid contact with the
home-keeping bees, which, at this time of year, have little more
to do <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>than loiter over the combs, or tuck themselves away in
the empty brood-cells by the hour together.&nbsp; But in her
desultory advance, she often cannons against single bees; and
then she may be either mildly interrogated, fiercely challenged,
or may be allowed to pass with a friendly stroke of the
antenn&aelig;, as though she were an orthodox member of the
hive.&nbsp; Again, you may see her recognised for a stranger by
three or four workers simultaneously.&nbsp; She will be
surrounded and closely questioned.&nbsp; The bees draw back and
confer among themselves in obvious doubt.&nbsp; The wasp knows
better than to await the result of their deliberations; by the
time they look for her again, she is gone.</p>
<p>She carries her life in her hand, and well she knows it.&nbsp;
The farther she goes, the more suspicious and menacing the bees
become.&nbsp; Now she has wild little scuffles here and there
with the boldest of them, but her superior adroitness and pace
save her at every turn.&nbsp; It is about an even wager that she
will reach the brimming honey-cells, load herself up to the chin,
and escape home to her paper-stronghold with her spoils.</p>
<p>As often as not, however, these hive-robbing wasps pay the
last great price for their temerity.&nbsp; Those who study
bee-life closely and unremittingly, year after year, find it
difficult to escape the conclusion that there are certain bees in
the crowd who are mentally and physically in advance of their
sisters.&nbsp; The notion of the old bee-keepers&mdash;that there
were generals and captains as well as rank-and-file in the
hive&mdash;seems, in fact, to be not entirely without latter-day
confirmation.&nbsp; And it is just the chance of falling in with
one of these bees <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>that constitutes, for the wasp, the main risk when
robbing the hives.</p>
<p>If this happens, there is no longer any doubt of the turn
affairs are to take.&nbsp; At an unlucky moment the wasp brushes
against one of these hive-constables and instead of indifference,
or, at most, a spiteful tweak of the leg or wing in passing, she
finds herself suddenly at deadly grips.&nbsp; The bee&rsquo;s
attack is as swift as it is furious.&nbsp; Seizing the yellow
honey-thief with all six legs, she hacks away at her with her
jaws, at the same time curving her body inwards with her cruel
sting bared to the hilt.&nbsp; Even now, although more than equal
to one bee at any time, the policy of the wasp is to refuse the
fight, and to run.&nbsp; Her long legs give her a better
reach.&nbsp; She forces her adversary away, disengages, and
charges off towards the dim light of the entrance.</p>
<p>In all that follows, this is the beacon that guides her.&nbsp;
If she could get a clear course, her greater speed would soon
out-distance all pursuit.&nbsp; But the sudden clash of arms in
the quiet of the hive has an extraordinary effect on the sluggish
colony.&nbsp; The alarm spreads on every side.&nbsp; Wherever the
wasp runs now she is met with snapping jaws and detaining
embraces.&nbsp; As she rushes madly down the comb, she is
continually pulled up in full flight by bees hanging on to her
legs, her wings, her black waving antenna.&nbsp; A dozen times
she shakes them all off, and speeds on, the spot of light and
safety in the distance ever growing brighter and larger.&nbsp;
But she seldom escapes with her life if affairs have reached this
pass.&nbsp; The way now is alive with enemies.&nbsp; She is
stopped and headed off in all directions.&nbsp; Trying this way
and that for a loophole, <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>she finally gives it up and turns on
her tracks, bewildered and panic-stricken, only to rush straight
into the midst of more foes.</p>
<p>The end is always the same.&nbsp; Another of the stalwarts
spies her, and in a moment the two are locked in berserk
conflict.&nbsp; Together they drop down between the combs and
thud to the bottom of the hive.&nbsp; Here it is hard to tell
what happens.&nbsp; The fight is so fierce and sharp, and the two
whirl round and tumble over and over together so wildly that you
can make out little else than a spinning blur of brown and
yellow.&nbsp; A great bright drop of honey flies off: in her
extremity the wasp has disgorged her spoils.&nbsp; Perhaps for an
instant the warriors may get wedged up in a corner, and then you
may see that they are not lunging at random with their stilettos,
but each is trying for a side-thrust on the body; these mail-clad
creatures are vulnerable to each other only at one
point&mdash;the spiracles, or breathing-holes.&nbsp; Often the
wasp deals the first fatal blow, and the bee drops off mortally
hurt.&nbsp; She may even dispose of three or four of her
assailants thus in quick succession.&nbsp; But each time another
bee closes with her at once.&nbsp; For the wasp there can only be
one end to it.&nbsp; Sooner or later she gets the finishing
stroke.</p>
<p>And then there follows a grim little comedy.&nbsp; The bee,
torn and ragged as she is from the incessant gnashing of those
razor-edged yellow jaws, nevertheless pauses not a moment.&nbsp;
She grips her dying adversary by the base of the wing, and
struggles off with her towards the entrance of the hive.&nbsp; It
is a hard job, but she succeeds at last.&nbsp; Alternately
pushing her burden before her, or dragging it <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>behind, at
length she wins out into the open, and, with a final desperate
effort, tumbles the wasp over the edge of the footboard down into
the grass below.&nbsp; Yet this is not enough.&nbsp; The victory
must be celebrated in the old warrior fashion.&nbsp; Rent and
bleeding and exhausted as she is, she finds she can still
fly.&nbsp; And up into the mellow sunbeams of the October morning
she sweeps, giddily and uncertainly, piercing the air with her
shrill song of triumph.&nbsp; Through the murmurous quiet of the
bee-garden, it rings out like a cry in the night.</p>

THE UNBUSY BEE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is well-nigh two months now
since the hives were packed down for the winter, and the bees are
flying as thick as on many a summer&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Yet no one could mistake their flight for the summer
flight.&nbsp; It is not the straight-away eager rush up into the
blue vault of the sunny morning&mdash;high away over hedgerow and
village roof-top towards the clover-fields, whitening the far-off
hillside with their tens of thousands of honey-brimming
bells.&nbsp; It is rather the vagrant, purposeless hanging-about
of an habitually busy people forced to make holiday.&nbsp;
Through it all there runs the pathetic interest in trifles,
half-hearted and wholly artificial, that you see among the
lolling crowd of men when a great strike is on&mdash;the
thoughtful kicking at odd pebbles; stride-measuring on the
flag-stones; little vortices of excitement got up over minute
incidents that would otherwise pass unnoticed; the earnest
flagellation of memory over past happenings more trivial
still.</p>
<p>Thus the bees idle about and wander, on this <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>still
November morning, doing just the things you would never expect a
bee to do.&nbsp; The greater number of them merely take long
desultory reaches a-wing through the sunshine, going off in one
objectless direction, turning about at the end of a few yards
with just as little apparent reason, coming back to the hive at
length on no more obvious errand than that, where there is
nothing to do, doing it in another place bears at least the
semblance of achievement.</p>
<p>But many of them succeed in conjuring up an almost ludicrous
assumption of business.&nbsp; One comes driving out of the
hive-entrance at a great pace, designedly, as you would think,
going out of her way to bustle the few bees lounging there, as if
the entrance-board were still thronged with the streaming crowd
of summer days foregone.&nbsp; She stops an instant to rub her
eyes clear of the hive-darkness; tries her wings a little to make
sure of their powers for a heavy load; then, with a deep note
like the twang of a guitar-string, launches out into the
sun-steeped air.&nbsp; But it is all a vain pretence, and well
she knows it.&nbsp; Watch her as she flies, and you will see her
busy ding-dong pace slacken a dozen yards away.&nbsp; She fetches
a turn or two above the leafless apple-branches of the garden,
with the rest of the chanting, workless crew.&nbsp; She may
presently start off again at a livelier speed than ever, as
though vexed at being allured, even for a moment, from the duty
that calls her away to the mist-clad hill.&nbsp; But it always
ends in the same fashion.&nbsp; A little later she is fluttering
down on the threshold of the silent hive, and running busily in,
keeping up the transparent fiction, you see, to the last.</p>
<h3><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span><i>An Officious Dame</i></h3>
<p>Many more set themselves to look for sweets where they must
know there is little likelihood of finding any.&nbsp; Scarce one
goes near the glowing belt of pompons rimming the garden on every
side.&nbsp; But here is one bee, an ancient dame, with ragged
wings and shiny thorax, poised outside a cranny in the old brick
wall, and examining it with serious, shrill inquiry.&nbsp; She is
obviously making-believe, to while away the time, that it is a
choice blossom full of nectar.&nbsp; She knows it is nothing of
the kind; but that will neither check her ardour nor expedite the
piece of play-acting.&nbsp; She spins it out to the utmost, and
leaves the one dusty crevice at last only to go through the same
performance at the next.</p>
<p>I often wonder wherein lies the fascination to a hive-bee of
an open window or door.&nbsp; Sitting here ledgering in the
little office of the bee-farm&mdash;where no honey, nor the smell
of honey, is ever allowed to come&mdash;sooner or later, in the
quiet of the golden morning, the familiar voice peals out.&nbsp;
It is startling at first, unless you are well used to
it&mdash;this sudden high-pitched clamour breaking the silence
about you; and the oldest bee-man must lay down pen or rule, and
look up from his work to scan the intruder.</p>
<p>She has darted in at the door, and has stopped in mid-air a
foot or two within the room.&nbsp; The sound she makes is very
different from that of a bee in ordinary flight.&nbsp; You cannot
mistake its meaning; it is one long-drawn-out, musical note of
exclamation, an intense, reiterated wonder at all about
her&mdash;the <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>subdued light, the walls covered with book-shelves, the
littered table, and the vast wingless, drab-coloured creature
sitting in the midst of it all, like a funnel-spider in his
snare.&nbsp; Bees entering a room in this way seldom stop more
than a second or two, and, more rarely still, alight.&nbsp; As a
rule, they are gone the next moment as swiftly as they came,
leaving the impression that their quick retreat was due to a
sudden accession of fear; just as children, venturing into some
dark unwonted place, at first boldly enough, will suddenly turn
tail and flee, with terror hard upon their heels.</p>
<p>But what should bring bees into such unlikely situations
during these warm bright breaks in the wintry weather, when they
seldom or never venture out of the range of hives and fields in
the season of plenty?&nbsp; It would be curious to know whether
people who have never kept bees, nor handled hives, are
habitually pried upon in this way; or whether it is only among
bee-men the thing occurs.&nbsp; Naturalists are commonly agreed
that bees possess an extraordinary sense of smell; indeed, the
fact is patent to all who know anything of hive-life.&nbsp; Now,
years of stinging render the bee-master immune to the ordinary
results of a prod from a bee&rsquo;s acid-charged stiletto.&nbsp;
There is only a sharp prick, a little irritation at the moment,
but seldom any after-effects of swelling or inflammation, local
or general.&nbsp; But all this injection of formic acid under the
skin year after year might very well have a cumulative effect, so
that the much-stung bee-man would eventually acquire in his own
person the permanent odour of the hive.&nbsp; And this, scented
afar off, may well be the attraction that brings these roving <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>scrutineers
to places having, in themselves, no sort of interest to the
winged hive-people.</p>
<h3><i>The Perils of</i> &ldquo;<i>Immunity</i>&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The mention of stinging brings back a thought that has often
occurred to me.&nbsp; Do lovers of honey ever quite realise the
price that must be paid before their favourite sweet is there for
them on the breakfast-table, filling the room with the mingled
perfume from a whole countryside?&nbsp; It is easy to talk of
immunity from the effect of bee-stings; but the truth is that
this immunity means, for the bee-master, no more than power to go
on with his work in spite of the stinging.&nbsp; And this power
is not a permanent one.&nbsp; It is brought about by incessant
pricks from the living poisoned needle; the ordeal must be
continuous, or the immunity will soon pass away.&nbsp; Over-care
in handling bees is good only up to a certain point.&nbsp; The
bee-man who, by continual practice, has brought this gentlest art
to its highest perfection, so that he can do what he likes with
his own bees without fear of harm, has, in a sense, created for
himself a kind of fools&rsquo; paradise.&nbsp; All the time his
once dear-bought privilege is slowly forsaking him.&nbsp; He is
like the Listerist faddist, who so destroys all disease germs in
his vicinity that his natural disease-resisting organisation
becomes atrophied through want of work.&nbsp; Then, perhaps, his
precautions are upheld for a season, whereupon a particularly
virulent microbe happens by; and, finding the house empty, swept,
and garnished, calls in the seven devils with a will.</p>
<p>Such a contingency is always in wait for <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>the
stay-at-home, never-stung bee-master of neighbourly
proclivities.&nbsp; Sooner or later he will be called to help
some maladroit in bee-craft, whose bees have been thoroughly
vitiated by years of &ldquo;monkeying.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then the
rod will come out of pickle to a lively tune.&nbsp; Of course, a
little stinging is nothing; but there is no doubt that, with
anything over a dozen stings or so at a time, the most hardened
and experienced bee-man may easily stand, for a minute or two at
least, in danger of losing his life.</p>
<p>So it happened to me once.&nbsp; I had gone to look at a
neighbour&rsquo;s stocks.&nbsp; The bees were as quiet as lambs
until I came to the seventh hive; and then, with hardly a note of
warning, they set upon me like a pack of flying bull-dogs.&nbsp;
It is long enough ago now, but I can still give a pretty accurate
account of the symptoms of acute formic-acid poisoning.&nbsp; It
began with a curious pricking and burning over the entire inner
surface of the mouth and throat.&nbsp; This rapidly spread, until
my whole body seemed on fire, and the target, as it were, for
millions of red-hot darts.&nbsp; Then first my tongue and lips,
and every other part of head and neck, in quick succession, began
to swell.&nbsp; My eyes felt as though they were being driven out
of my head.&nbsp; My breathing machinery seized up, and all but
stopped.&nbsp; A giddy congestion of brain followed.&nbsp;
Finally, sight and hearing failed, and then almost
consciousness.</p>
<p>I can just remember crawling away, and thrusting head and
shoulders deep into a thick lilac bush, where the bees ceased to
molest me.&nbsp; But it was a good hour or more before I could
hold the smoker straight again, and get on with the next
stock.</p>
<h2><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
THE LONG NIGHT IN THE HIVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few things more
mystifying to the student of bee-life than the way in which
winter is passed in the hive.&nbsp; Probably nineteen out of
every twenty people, who take a merely theoretical interest in
the subject, entertain no doubt on the matter.&nbsp; Bees
hibernate, they will tell you&mdash;pass the winter in a state of
torpor, just as many other insects, reptiles, and animals have
been proved to do.&nbsp; And, though the truth forces itself upon
scientific investigators that there is no such thing as
hibernation, in the accepted sense of the word, among hive-bees,
the perplexing part of the whole question is that, as far as
modern observers understand it, the honey-bee ought to hibernate,
even if, as a matter of fact, she does not.</p>
<p>For consider what a world of trouble would be saved if, at the
coming of winter, the worker-bees merely got together in a
compact cluster in their warm nook, with the queen in their
midst; and thenceforward slept the long cold months away, until
the hot March sun struck into them with the tidings that the
willows&mdash;first caterers for the year&rsquo;s <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>winged
myriads&mdash;were in golden flower once more; and there was
nothing to do but rouse, and take their fill.&nbsp; It would
revolutionise the whole aspect of bee-life, and, to all
appearances, vastly for the better.&nbsp; There would be no more
need to labour through the summer days, laying up winter
stores.&nbsp; Life could become for the honey-bee what it is to
most other insects&mdash;merry and leisurely.&nbsp; There would
be time for dancing in the sunbeams, and long siestas under
rose-leaves; and it would be enough if each little worker took
home an occasional full honey-sac or two for the babies, instead
of wearing out nerve and body in all that desperate toiling to
and fro.</p>
<p>Yet, for some inscrutable reason, the honey-bee elects to keep
awake&mdash;uselessly awake, it seems&mdash;throughout the four
months or so during which outdoor work is impossible; and to this
apparently undesirable, unprofitable end, she sacrifices all that
makes such a life as hers worth the living from a human point of
view.</p>
<h3><i>Restlessness</i>, <i>and the Reason for It</i></h3>
<p>You can, however, seldom look at wild Nature&rsquo;s ways from
the human standpoint without danger of postulating too much, or,
worse still, leaving some vital, though invisible thing out of
the argument.&nbsp; And this latter, on a little farther
consideration, proves to be what we are now doing.&nbsp;
Prolonged study of hive-life in winter will reveal one hitherto
unsuspected fact.&nbsp; At this time, far from settling down into
a life of sleepy inactivity, the queen-bee seems to develop a
restlessness and impatience not <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>to be observed in her at any other
season.&nbsp; It is clear that the workers would lie quiet
enough, if they had only themselves to consider.&nbsp; They
collect in a dense mass between the central combs of the hive,
the outer members of the company just keeping in touch with the
nearest honey-cells.&nbsp; These cells are broached by the
furthermost bees, and the food is distributed from tongue to
tongue.&nbsp; As the nearest store-cells are emptied, the whole
concourse moves on, the compacted crowd of bees thus journeying
over the comb at a pace which is steady yet inconceivably
slow.</p>
<p>But this policy seems in no way to commend itself to the
queen.&nbsp; Whenever you look into the hive, even on the coldest
winter&rsquo;s day, she is generally alert and stirring, keeping
the worker-bees about her in a constant state of wakefulness and
care.&nbsp; Though she has long since ceased to lay, she is
always prying about the comb, looking apparently for empty cells
wherein to lay eggs, after her summer habit.&nbsp; Night or day,
she seems always in this unresting state of mind, and the work of
getting their queen through the winter season is evidently a
continual source of worry to the members of the colony.&nbsp;
Altogether, the most logical inference to be drawn from any
prolonged and careful investigation of hive-life in winter is
that the queen-bee herself is the main obstacle to any system of
hibernation being adopted in the hive.&nbsp; This lying-by for
the cold weather, however desirable and practicable it may be for
the great army of workers, is obviously dead against the natural
instincts of the queen.&nbsp; And since, being awake, she must be
incessantly watched and fed and <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>cared for, it follows that the whole
colony must wake with her, or at least as many as are necessary
to keep her nourished and preserved from harm.</p>
<h3><i>The Queen a Slave to Tradition</i></h3>
<p>Those, however, who are familiar with the resourceful nature
of the honey-bee might expect her to effect an ingenious
compromise in these as in all other circumstances; and the facts
seem to point to such a compromise.&nbsp; It is not easy to be
sure of anything when watching the winter cluster in a hive, for
the bees lie so close that inspection becomes at times almost
futile.&nbsp; But one thing at least is certain.&nbsp; The
brood-combs between which the cluster forms are not merely
covered by bees.&nbsp; Into every cell in the comb some bee has
crept, head first, and lies there quite motionless.&nbsp; This
attitude is also common at other times of the year, and there is
little doubt that the tired worker-bees do rest, and probably
sleep, thus, whenever an empty cell is available.&nbsp; But now
almost the entire range of brood-cells is filled with resting
bees, like sailors asleep in the bunks of a forecastle; and it is
not unreasonable to suppose that each unit in the cluster
alternately watches with the queen, or takes her &ldquo;watch
below&rdquo; in the comb-cells.</p>
<p>That there should be in this matter of wintering so sharp a
divergence between the instincts of the queen-mother and her
children is in no way surprising, when we recollect how entirely
they differ on almost all other points.&nbsp; How this
fundamental difference has come about in the course of ages of
bee-life is too long a story for these pages.&nbsp; It has <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>been fully
dealt with in an earlier volume by the same
writer&mdash;&ldquo;The Lore of the Honey-Bee&rdquo;&mdash;and to
this the reader is referred.&nbsp; But the fact is pretty
generally admitted that, while the little worker-bee is a
creature specially evolved to suit a unique environment, the
mother-bee remains practically identical with the mother-bees of
untold ages back.&nbsp; She retains many of the instincts of the
race as it existed under tropic conditions, when there was no
alternation of hot and cold seasons; and hence her complete
inability to understand, and consequent rebellion against the
needs of modern times.</p>
<h3><i>The Future Evolution of the Hive</i></h3>
<p>Whether the worker-bees will ever teach her to conform to the
changed conditions is an interesting problem.&nbsp; We know how
they have &ldquo;improved&rdquo; life in the hive&mdash;how a
matriarchal system of government has been established there, the
duty of motherhood relegated to one in the thirty thousand or so,
and how the males are suffered to live only so long as their
procreative powers are useful to the community.&nbsp; It is
little likely that the omnipotent worker-bee will stop
here.&nbsp; Failing the eventual production of a queen-bee who
can be put to sleep for the winter, they may devise means of
getting rid of her in the same way as they disburden themselves
of the drones.&nbsp; In some future age the mother-bee may be
ruthlessly slaughtered at the end of each season, another queen
being raised when breeding-time again comes round.&nbsp; Then, no
doubt, honey-bees would hibernate, as do so many <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>other
creatures of the wilds; and the necessity for all that frantic
labour throughout the summer days be obviated.</p>
<p>This is by no means so fantastic a notion as it appears.&nbsp;
Ingenious as is the worker-bee, there is one thing that the mere
man-scientist of to-day could teach her.&nbsp; At present, her
system of queen-production is to construct a very large cell,
four or five times as large as that in which the common worker is
raised.&nbsp; Into this cell, at an early stage in its
construction, the old queen is induced to deposit an egg; or the
workers themselves may furnish it with an egg previously laid
elsewhere; or again&mdash;as sometimes happens&mdash;the large
cell may be erected over the site of an ordinary worker-cell
already containing a fertile ovum.&nbsp; This egg in no way
differs from that producing the common, undersized, sex-atrophied
worker-bee; but by dint of super-feeding on a specially rich
diet, and unlimited space wherein to develop, the young grub
eventually grows into a queen-bee, with all the queen&rsquo;s
extraordinary attributes.&nbsp; A queen may be, and often is,
raised by the workers from a grub instead of an egg.&nbsp; The
grub is enclosed in, or possibly in some cases transferred to,
the queen-cell; and, providing it is not more than three days
old, this grub will also become a fully developed queen-bee.</p>
<h3><i>Hibernation</i>, <i>and no Honey</i></h3>
<p>But, thus far in the history of bee-life, it has been
impossible for a hive to re-queen itself unless a newly-laid egg,
or very young larva, has been available for the purpose.&nbsp;
Hibernation without a <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>queen is, therefore, in the present
stage of honey-bee wisdom, unattainable, because there would be
neither egg nor grub to work from in the spring, when another
queen-mother was needed, and the stock must inevitably
perish.&nbsp; Here, however, the scientific bee-master could give
his colonies an invaluable hint, though greatly to his own
disadvantage.&nbsp; In the ordinary heat of the brood-chamber an
egg takes about three days to hatch, but it has been ascertained
that a sudden fall in temperature will often delay this
process.&nbsp; The germ of life in all eggs is notoriously hardy;
and it is conceivable that by a system of cold storage, as
carefully studied and ingeniously regulated as are most other
affairs of the hive, the bees might succeed in preserving eggs
throughout the winter in a state of suspended, but not
irresuscitable life.&nbsp; And if ever the honey-bee, in some
future age, discovers this possibility, she will infallibly
become a true hibernating insect, and join the ranks of the
summer loiterers and merry-makers.&nbsp; But the bee-master will
get no more honey.</p>

189</span>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
THE AUTOCRAT OF THE BEE-GARDEN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Books</span>,&rdquo; said the
Bee-Master of Warrilow, looking round through grey wreaths of
tobacco-smoke at his crowded shelves, &ldquo;books seem to tell
ye most things ne&rsquo;ersome-matter; but when it comes to books
on bees&mdash;well, &rsquo;tis somehow quite another pair
o&rsquo; shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to listen to the wind, blowing great guns outside
in the winter darkness.&nbsp; The little cottage seemed to crouch
and shudder beneath the blast, and the rain drove against the
lattice-windows with a sobbing, timorous note.&nbsp; The
bee-master drew the old oak settle nearer to the fire, and sat
for a moment silently watching the comfortable blaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;True as print,&rsquo;&rdquo; he went on, lapsing
more and more into the quaint, tangy Sussex dialect, as his theme
impressed him; &ldquo;&rsquo;twas an old saying o&rsquo; my
father&rsquo;s; and right enough, maybe, in his time.&nbsp;
A&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t read, to be sure; so a&rsquo; might have
been ower unsceptical.&nbsp; But books was too expensive in those
days to put many lies into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took down at random from the case on the <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>chimney-breast about a dozen modern, paper-covered
treatises on bee-keeping, and threw them, rather contemptuously,
on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying, mind ye,&rdquo; he hastened to
add, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s a word against truth in any one of
them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all true enough, no doubt, for they
contradict each other at every turn.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis as if one
man said roses was white; and another said, &lsquo;No,
you&rsquo;re wrong, they&rsquo;re yaller&rsquo;; and a third
said, &lsquo;Y&rsquo;are both wrong, they&rsquo;re
red.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when folks are in dispute in this way,
because they agree, and not because they differ, there&rsquo;s
little hope of ever pacifying them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard tell once of a woman bee-keeper years ago, that
had a good word about bees.&nbsp; Said she, &lsquo;They never do
anything invariably&rsquo;; and she warn&rsquo;t far off the
truth.&nbsp; She knew her own sex, did wise Mrs Tupper.&nbsp;
Now, the trouble with the book-writers on bees is that they try
to make a science of something that can never rightly be a
science at all.&nbsp; They try to add two numbers together that
they don&rsquo;t know, an&rsquo; that are allers changing, and
are surprised if they don&rsquo;t arrive at an exact total.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s the bees, and there&rsquo;s the weather: together
the result will be so many pounds of honey.&nbsp; If the English
climate went by the calendar, and the bees worked according to
unchangeable rules, you might reckon out your honey-take within a
spoonful, and bee-keeping would be little more than sitting in a
summer-house and figuring on a slate.&nbsp; But with frosts in
June, and August weather in February, and your honey-makers
naught but a tribe of whimsy, sex-thwarted wimmin-folk, a nation
of everlasting spinsters&mdash;how <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>can bee-keeping be anything else
than a kind of walking-tower in a furrin land, when every twist
an&rsquo; turn o&rsquo; the way shows something cur&rsquo;ous or
different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to recharge his pipe from the earthen tobacco-jar,
shaped like an old straw beehive, which had yielded solace to
many a past generation of the Warrilow clan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis just this matter of sex,&rdquo; he
continued, &ldquo;that these book-writing bee-masters seem to
leave altogether out of their reckoning.&nbsp; And yet it lies
well to the heart of the whole business.&nbsp; In an average
prosperous hive there are about thirty thousand of these little
stunted, quick-witted worker-bees, not one of which but could
have grown into a fully-developed mother-bee, twice the size, and
laying her thousands of eggs a day, if only her early
bringings-up had been different.&nbsp; But nature has doomed her
to be an old maid from her very cradle, although she is born with
all the instincts and capabilities for motherhood that you wonder
at in a fully grown, prolific queen.&nbsp; And yet the
bee-masters expect her to accept her fate without a murmur; to
live and work to-day just as she did yesterday and the day
before; to tend and feed patiently the young bees that she has
been denied all part in producing; to support a lot of lazy
drones in luxury and idleness; and generally to act like a
reasonable, contented, happy creature all the way
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took three or four long, contemplative pulls at his
Broseley clay, then came back to his subject and his dialect
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis no wonder,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;that the
little <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>worker-bee gets crotchety time an&rsquo; again.&nbsp;
Wimmin-creeturs is all of much the same kidney, whether
&rsquo;tis bees or humans.&nbsp; Their natur&rsquo; is not to
look ahead, but just to do the next thing.&nbsp; They sees
sideways mostly, like a horse with an eye-shade but no
blinkers.&nbsp; But now and then they ups and looks straight
afore &rsquo;em, and then &rsquo;tis trouble brewing fer masters
o&rsquo; all kinds, whether in hives or homes o&rsquo; men.&nbsp;
Lot&rsquo;s wife, she were a kind o&rsquo; bee-woman; and so were
Eve.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been glad to ha&rsquo; knowed
&rsquo;em both, bless &rsquo;em!&nbsp; The world &rsquo;ud be all
the sweeter fer a few more like they.&nbsp; Harm done through
being too much of a woman-creetur is never all harm in the long
run, depend on&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his great sunburnt hand he stirred the flimsy, dog-eared
pamphlets about thoughtfully, as a man will stir leaves with a
stick.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, &rsquo;tis just this way with bees,&rdquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you study how to keep &rsquo;em busy, with
plain, right-down necessity hard at their heels, all goes
well.&nbsp; The bees have no time for anything but work.&nbsp; As
the supers fill with honey you take them off and put empty ones
in their place.&nbsp; The queen below fills comb after comb with
eggs, and you make the brood-nest larger and larger.&nbsp; There
is allers more room everywhere, dropped down from the skies,
like; no matter how fast the stock increases, nor how much the
bees bring in.&nbsp; Just their plain day&rsquo;s work is enough,
and more&rsquo;n enough, for the best of them.&nbsp; And so the
summer heat goes by; the honey harvest is ended; and the bees
have had no chance to dwell upon, and grow rebellious over, the
wise wrong that nature has done their sex.&nbsp; In bee-life
&rsquo;tis always evil that&rsquo;s <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>wrought, not by want o&rsquo;
thought, but by too much of it.&nbsp; Bad beemanship is just
giving bees time to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the time,&rdquo; continued the bee-master,
thrusting the bowl of his empty pipe into the heart of the
wood-embers for lustration, and taking a clean one down for
immediate use from the rack over his head; &ldquo;many&rsquo;s
the time an&rsquo; oft it has come ower me that perhaps bees
warn&rsquo;t allers as we see them now.&nbsp; Maybe, way back in
the times when England was a tropic country, tens of thousands
o&rsquo; years ago, there was no call for them to live packed
together in one dark chamber, as they do to-day.&nbsp; If the
year was warm all the twelve months through, and flowers allers
blooming, there &rsquo;ud be no need fer a winter-larder, nor fer
any hives at all.&nbsp; Like as not each woman-bee lived by
herself then, in some dry nook or other; made her little nest of
comb, and brought up her own children, happy and
comfortable.&nbsp; Maybe, even&mdash;and I can well believe it of
her, knowing her natur&rsquo; as I do&mdash;she kept a gurt,
buzzing, blusterous drone about the place an&rsquo; let him eat
and drink in idleness while she did all the work, willing enough,
for the two.&nbsp; Then, as the world slowly cooled down through
the centuries, there came a short time in each year when the
flowers ceased to bloom, and the bees found they had to put by a
store of honey, to last till the heat and the blossoms showed up
again.&nbsp; And there was another thing they must have found out
when the cold spell was over the earth.&nbsp; Bees that kept
apart by themselves died of cold, but those that huddled together
in crowds lived warm enough throughout the winter.&nbsp; The more
there were of &rsquo;em the <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>warmer they kept, and the less food
they needed.&nbsp; And so, as the winters got longer and colder,
the bee-colonies increased, until at last, from force of habit,
they took to keeping together all the year round.&nbsp; So you
see, like as not, &rsquo;tis experience as has brought &rsquo;em
to build their cities of to-day, just as experience, or the One
ye never mention, has put the same thing into the hearts o&rsquo;
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden flaw of wind struck the little cottage with a sound
like thunder, and made the cut-glass lustres on the mantle tinkle
and glitter in the yellow candle-glow.&nbsp; The old bee-man
stopped, with his pipe half-way to his mouth, nodded gravely
towards the window, in a kind of obeisance to the elements, and
then resumed his theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a many things about bees,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that no man &rsquo;ull come to the rights of, until
all airthly things is made clear in the Day o&rsquo; Days.&nbsp;
The great trouble and hindrance to bee-keeping is the swarm, and
a good bee-master nowadays tries all he can to circumvent
it.&nbsp; But the old habit comes back again and again, and often
with stocks of bees that haven&rsquo;t had a fit o&rsquo; it for
years.&nbsp; Now, did ye ever think what swarming must have been
in the beginning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly levelled the pipe-stem straight at my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;tis all speckilation, but here&rsquo;s my
idee o&rsquo; it, for what &rsquo;tis worth.&nbsp; Take the
wapses: they&rsquo;re thousands of years behind the honey-bee in
development, and so they give ye a look, so to speak, into the
past.&nbsp; The end of a wapse-colony comes when the females are
ready in November; and hundreds of them go off to hide for the
winter, each <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>in some hole or crevice, until, in the warm spring
days, each comes out to start a new and separate home.&nbsp;
Well, perhaps the honey-bees did much the same thing long ago,
when they were all mother-bees, in the time when the world was
young.&nbsp; And perhaps the swarm-fever in a hive to-day is
naught but a kind o&rsquo; memory of this, still working, though
its main use is gone.&nbsp; The books here will tell ye o&rsquo;
many other things brought about by swarming, right an&rsquo; good
enough with the old-fashioned hives.&nbsp; Yet that gainsays
nothing.&nbsp; Nature allers works double an&rsquo; treble handed
in all her dealings.&nbsp; Her every stroke tells far and wide,
like the thousand ripples you make when you pitch a stone in a
pond.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
HONEY-CRAFT OLD AND NEW</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> never comes, in early April,
that first bright hot day which means the beginning of outdoor
work on the bee-farm, but I fall to thinking of old times with a
great longing to have them back again.</p>
<p>Modern beemanship, at least to the wide-awake folk in the
craft, brings in gold pieces now where formerly one had much ado
to make shillings.&nbsp; But profit cannot always be reckoned in
money.&nbsp; The old mysteries and the old delusions were a sort
of capital that paid cent per cent if you only humoured them
aright.&nbsp; Bee-men, who flourished when there was a young
queen upon the throne, wore their ignorance as the parson his
silk and lawn.&nbsp; It was something that set them apart and
above their neighbours.&nbsp; All that the bees did was put to
their credit, just for the trouble of a wise wag of the head and
a little timely reticence.&nbsp; The organ-blower worked in full
view of the congregation, while the player sat invisibly within,
so the blower, after the common trend of earthly affairs, got all
the glory for the tune.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>There
are no mysteries now in honey-craft.&nbsp; Science has dragooned
the fairies out of sight and hearing as a man treads out sparks
in the whin.&nbsp; But, though the mysteries have gone, the old
music of the hives is still here as sweet as ever.&nbsp; This
morning, when the sun was but an hour over the hilltop, I rose
from my bed, and, coming down the creaking stair through the
silence and half-darkness, threw the heavy old house-door
back.&nbsp; At once the level sunshine and the song of bees and
birds came pouring in together.&nbsp; There was the loud humming
of bees in the leafing honeysuckle of the porch, and the soft low
note of the hives beyond.&nbsp; In its plan to-day Warrilow
Bee-farm reveals the whole story of its growth from times long
gone to the present.&nbsp; All the hives near the cottage are
old-fashioned skeps of straw, covered in with three sticks and a
hackle.&nbsp; A little way down the slope the ancient bee-boxes
begin, eight-sided Stewartons mostly, with the green veneer of
decades upon some of them.&nbsp; Beyond these stand the first
rack-frame hives that ever came to Warrilow; and thence,
stretching away down the sunny hillside in long trim rows, are
the modern frame-bar hives, spick and span in their new
Joseph&rsquo;s coats of paint, with the gillyflowers driving
golden shafts between them, until they reach the line of
sheds&mdash;comb and honey-stores, extracting-house, and
workshops&mdash;marking the distant lane-side.</p>
<h3><i>The Water-carriers</i></h3>
<p>As I stood in the doorway, caught by the mesmeric sheen of the
light and the beauty of the morning, the <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>humming of
the bees overhead grew louder and louder.&nbsp; There were no
flowers as yet to attract them, but in early April the dense
canopy of honeysuckle here is always besieged with bees, directly
the sun has warmed the clinging dewdrops.&nbsp; These were the
water-carriers from the hives.&nbsp; Water at this time is one of
the main necessities of bee-life.&nbsp; With it the workers are
able to reduce the thick honey and the dry pollen to the right
consistency for consumption, and can then generate the bee-milk
with which the young larv&aelig; are fed.&nbsp; Later on in the
day the water-fetchers will crowd in hundreds to the oozy
pond-side down in the valley&mdash;every bee-garden has its
ancestral drinking-place invariably resorted to year after
year.&nbsp; But thus early the pond-water is too cold for safe
transport by so chilly a mortal as the little worker-bee; so
Nature warms a temporary supply for her here where the dew
trembles like drops of molten rainbow at the tip of each woodbine
leaf.</p>
<p>I drank myself a deep draught from the well that goes down a
sheer sixty feet into the virgin chalk of the hillside, and fell
to loitering through the garden ways.&nbsp; Though it was so
early, the little oil-engine down below in the hive-making shed
was already coughing shrilly through its vent-pipe, and the saw
thrumming.&nbsp; Here and there among the hives my men stooped at
their work.&nbsp; The pony was harnessing to the cart, and would
soon be plodding the three-mile-long road to the station with the
day&rsquo;s deliveries of honey.&nbsp; By all laws of duty I
should be down there, taking my row of hives with the
rest&mdash;master and men side by side like a string of
turnip-hoers&mdash;busy at the spring examination <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>which, as
all bee-men know, is the most important work of the year.&nbsp;
But the very thought of opening hives, now in the first warm
break of April weather or at any time, filled me with a strange
loathing.&nbsp; So it never used to be, never could be, in the
old days whose memory always comes flooding back to me at this
season with such a clear call and such a hindrance to progress
and duty.&nbsp; Then I had as little dreamed of opening a hive as
opening a vein.&nbsp; I should have done no more than I was doing
now&mdash;passing from one old straw skep to another through the
sweet vernal sunshine, my boots scattering the dew from the grass
as I went, and looking for signs that tell the bee-man nearly all
he really needs to know.&nbsp; I shut my ears to the throaty song
of the engine.&nbsp; I heard the cart drive away without a
thought of scanning its load.&nbsp; I got me down in a little
nook of red currant flowers under the wall, where the old straw
hives were thickest, and gave myself up to idle dreams, dreams of
the bees and bee-men of long ago.</p>
<p>I should be splitting elder, thought I; splitting the long,
straight wands to make feeding-troughs.&nbsp; I called to mind
doing it, here on this self-same bench near upon fifty years ago,
with my father, the woodman, sitting at my elbow learning
me.&nbsp; We split the wands clean and true, scooped out the pith
from each half, and dammed up its ends with clay.&nbsp; Then,
with a handful of these crescent troughs and a can of syrup, we
went the round of the garden together looking for stocks that
were short of stores.&nbsp; When we found one, we pushed the
hollow slip of elder gently into the hive-entrance as far as it
would go, and filled it with syrup, filling it <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>again and
again throughout the day as the bees within drank it dry.</p>
<h3><i>The Old Style and the New</i></h3>
<p>A queer figure my father cut in his short grey smock and his
long lean bent legs encased in leathern gaiters, legs between
which, when I was little, and trotting after him, I had always a
fine view of the sky.&nbsp; He was never at fault in his estimate
of a hive&rsquo;s prosperity.&nbsp; The rich clear song and
steady traffic of a well-to-do bee-nation he knew at once from
the anxious note and frantic coming and going of a
starvation-threatened hive.&nbsp; It was the tune that told
him.&nbsp; Nowadays we just rip the coverings from a hive and,
lifting the combs out one by one, judge by sheer brute-force of
eyesight whether there be need or plenty.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One-thirty-two!&rdquo;&mdash;from my sunny seat under the
pink currant blossom I can hear the call of the foreman to the
booking &rsquo;prentice down in the
bee-farm&mdash;&ldquo;One-thirty-two&mdash;six frames
covered&mdash;no moth&mdash;medium light&mdash;brood over
three&mdash;mark R.Q.&rdquo;&nbsp; R.Q. means that the stock is
to be re-queened at the earliest opportunity.&nbsp; She has been
a famous queen in her time&mdash;One-thirty-two.&nbsp; This would
have been her fourth year, had she kept up her fertility.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;brood over three&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say, only
three combs with young bees maturing in them&mdash;is not good
enough for progressive, up-to-date Warrilow in April, and she
must be pinched at last.&nbsp; In the common course, I never let
a queen remain at the head of affairs after her second
season.&nbsp; Nine out of ten of them break down under the wear
and stress <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>of two summers, and fall to useless drone-breeding in
the third.</p>
<p>Already the sun has climbed high, and yet I linger, though I
know I should be gone an hour ago.&nbsp; The darkness, far away
as it seems, will not find all done that should be done on the
bee-farm, toil as hard as we may.&nbsp; For these sudden hot days
in spring often come singly, and every moment of them is
precious.&nbsp; To-morrow the north wind may be keening under an
iron-grey sky, and pallid wreaths of snow-flakes weighing down
the almond-blossom.&nbsp; So it happened only a year ago, when on
the twenty-fifth of April I must clear away the snow from the
entrance-boards of the hives.&nbsp; It is, I think, the unending
round of business&mdash;the itch that is on us now of finding a
day&rsquo;s work for every day in the year in modern
beecraft&mdash;which has had most to do with the changed
times.&nbsp; The old leisure, as well as the old colour and
mystery, has gone out of bee-keeping.&nbsp; Between burning-time
in August and swarming-time in May there used to be little else
for the bee-master to do but smoke his pipe and ruminate and
watch the wax flowing into the hives.&nbsp; For we all believed
that the little pellets of many-tinted pollen which the bees
constantly carry in on their thighs were not food for the grubs
in the cells, but wax for the comb-building.&nbsp; I could
believe it now, indeed, if I might only sit here long enough; but
the busy voices are calling, calling, and I must be gone.</p>

THE BEE-MILK MYSTERY</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the innumerable scraps of
more or less erroneous information on hive-life, dished up by the
popular newspapers in course of the year&rsquo;s round, there is
occasionally one which is sure to grip the curious reader&rsquo;s
attention.&nbsp; No one expects nowadays to read of the honey-bee
without being set agape at the marvellous; but, really, when he
is gravely told that the nurse-bees in a hive actually give the
breast to their young, suckling them with a secreted liquid which
is nothing more or less than milk, the ordinarily faithful
newspaper student is entitled to be for once incredulous.</p>
<p>The thing, however, in spite of its grotesque improbability,
comes nearer to the plain truth than many another item of
bee-life more often encountered and unquestionably
accepted.&nbsp; There are veritable nurse-bees in a hive, and
these do produce something not unlike milk.&nbsp; In about three
days after the egg has been deposited in the comb-cell by the
queen, or mother-bee, a tiny white grub emerges.&nbsp; The
feeding of this grub is immediately commenced by the bees in
charge of the nursery quarters of the <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>hive, and there is administered to
it a glistening white substance closely resembling thick
cream.</p>
<p>Analysts tell us that this bee-milk, as it is called, is
highly nitrogenous in character, and that it has a decidedly acid
reaction.&nbsp; It is obviously produced from the mouths of the
nurse-bees, and appears to be digested matter thrown up from some
part of the bee&rsquo;s internal system, and combined with the
secretions from one or more of the four separate sets of glands
which open into different parts of the worker-bee&rsquo;s
mouth.&nbsp; The power to secrete this bee-milk seems to be
normally limited to those workers who are under fourteen or
fifteen days old.&nbsp; After that time the bee runs dry, her
nursing work is relinquished, and she goes out to forage for
nectar and pollen, never, as far as is known, resuming the task
of feeding the young grubs.&nbsp; But if the faculty is not
exercised, it may be held in abeyance for months together.&nbsp;
This takes place at the close of each year, when we know that the
last bees born to the hive in autumn are those who supply the
milk for the first batches of larva raised in the ensuing
spring.</p>
<p>It is difficult to keep out the wonder-weaving mood when
writing of any phase of hive-life, and especially so when we have
this bee-milk under consideration.&nbsp; For all recent studies
of the matter tend to prove several facts about it not merely
wonderful, but verging on the mysterious.</p>
<p>In the first place, its composition seems to be variable at
the will of the bees.&nbsp; The white liquid is supplied to the
grubs of worker, queen, and drone, and not only is its nature
different with each, but it is even possible that this may be
farther modified <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>in the various stages of their development.&nbsp; It is
well ascertained that the physical and temperamental differences
between queen and worker-bee, widely marked as they appear, are
entirely due to treatment and feeding during the larval
stage.&nbsp; That the eggs producing the two are identical is
proved by the fact that these can be transposed without
confounding the original purpose of the hive.&nbsp; The queen-egg
placed in the worker-cell develops into a common worker, while
the worker-egg, when exalted to a queen&rsquo;s cradle,
infallibly produces a fully accoutred queen bee.&nbsp; The
experiment can also be made even with the young grubs, provided
that these are no more than three days old, and the same result
ensues.</p>
<p>A close study of the food administered to bees when in the
larval stage of their career is specially interesting, because it
gives us the key to many otherwise inexplicable matters connected
with hive-life.&nbsp; We do not know, and probably never shall
know, how mere variation in diet causes certain organs to appear
and certain other bodily parts to absent themselves.&nbsp; If the
difference between queen and worker-bee were simply one of
development, the worker being only an undersized, semi-atrophied
specimen of a queen, there would be little mystery about
it.&nbsp; But each has several highly specialised organs, of
which the other has no trace, just as each has certain functions
reduced to mere rudimentary uselessness, which, in the other,
possess enormous development and a corresponding importance.</p>
<p>Clearly the food given in each case has peculiar properties,
bringing about certain definite invariable <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>results.&nbsp; We are able, therefore, to say
positively that most of the classic marvels of bee-life are built
up on this one determined issue, this one logical adjustment of
cause and effect.&nbsp; The hive creates thousands of sexless
workers and only one fertile mother-bee.&nbsp; It limits the
number of its offspring according to the visible food supplies or
the needs of the commonwealth.&nbsp; It brings into existence,
when necessity calls for them, hundreds of male bees or drones,
and when their period of usefulness is over it decrees their
extermination.&nbsp; When the queen&rsquo;s fecundity declines,
it raises another queen to take her place.&nbsp; It can even,
under certain rare conditions of adversity, manufacture what is
known as a fertile worker, when some mischance has deprived it of
its mother-bee and the materials for providing a legitimate
successor to her are not forthcoming.&nbsp; And all these results
are primarily brought about by the one means, the one vehicle of
mystery&mdash;this wonderful bee-milk playing its part at all
stages in the honey-bee&rsquo;s life from her cradle to her
grave.</p>
<p>For to track down this subtly-compounded elixir through all
its various uses one must take a survey of almost the whole round
of activities in the hive.&nbsp; The food of the young larva,
whether of queen or worker, for the first three days after the
eggs are hatched, seems to consist entirely of bee-milk.&nbsp;
The drone-grub gets an extra day of this richly nitrogenous
diet.&nbsp; And for the remaining two days of the grub stage of
the bee&rsquo;s life milk is given continuously, but, in the case
of the worker and drone, in greatly diminished supply.&nbsp; Its
place during these two days is largely taken, it is said, by <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>honey and
digested pollen in the worker&rsquo;s instance, and by honey and
raw pollen for the males.</p>
<p>The queen-grub alone receives bee-milk, of a specially rich
kind and in unlimited quantity, for the whole of her larval
life.&nbsp; This &ldquo;royal jelly,&rdquo; as the old
bee-masters termed it, is literally poured into the capacious
queen-cell.&nbsp; For the whole five days of her existence as a
larva she actually bathes in it up to the eyes.&nbsp; But, as far
as is known, she receives no other food during this time.&nbsp;
The regular order of her development, and of that of the
worker-bee, during the five days of the grub stage has been
carefully studied, and it is curious to note that the very time
when the queen&rsquo;s special organs of motherhood begin to show
themselves coincides exactly with the moment at which the
worker-grub&rsquo;s allowance of bee-milk is cut down and other
food substituted.</p>
<p>This, no doubt, explains why these organs in the adult
worker-bee are so elementary as to be practically non-existent,
and accounts for the queen&rsquo;s generous growth in other
directions.&nbsp; But it leaves us completely in the dark as to
the reason for the worker&rsquo;s subsequent elaboration of such
organs as the pollen-carrying device, the so-called wax-pincers,
and the wax-secreting glands, of which the queen possesses
none.&nbsp; Nor are we able to see how the giving or withholding
of the bee-milk should furnish the queen with a long curved sting
and the worker with a short straight one; nor how mere
manipulation of diet can result in making the two so dissimilar
in temperament and mental attributes&mdash;the worker laborious,
sociable, almost preternaturally alert of mind, and withal
essentially <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>a creature of the open air and sunshine; the queen dull
of intelligence, possessed of a jealous hatred of her peers, for
whom all the light and colour and fragrance of a summer&rsquo;s
morning have no allurements, a being whose every instinct keeps
her, from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, pent in the
crowded tropic gloom of the hive.</p>
<p>But the bee-milk as well as being the main ingredient in the
larval food, has other and almost equally important uses.&nbsp;
It is supplied by the workers to the adult queen and drones
throughout nearly the whole of their lives, and forms an
indispensable part of their daily diet.&nbsp; And this gives us a
clue in our attempt to understand, not only how the population of
the hive is regulated, but why the males are so easily disposed
of when the annual drone-massacre sets in.&nbsp; By giving or
depriving her of the bee-milk, the workers can either stimulate
the queen to an enormous daily output of eggs or reduce her
fertility to a bare minimum; and, as for the drones, it is
starvation that is the secret of their half-hearted, feeble
resistance to fate.</p>
<p>Yet though we may recount these things, and speak of this
mysterious essence called bee-milk as really the mainspring of
all effort and achievement within the hive, it is doubtful
whether we have solved the greatest mystery of all about
it.&nbsp; Of what is it composed, and whence is it derived?&nbsp;
The generally-accepted explanation of its origin is that it is
pollen-chyle regurgitated from the second stomach of the bee,
combined with the secretions from certain glands of the mouth in
passing.&nbsp; But the most careful dissections have never
revealed anything like bee-milk in any part of the bee&rsquo;s <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>internal
system.&nbsp; Its pure white, opaque quality has absolutely no
counterpart there: nor, indeed&mdash;if we are to believe latest
investigations&mdash;does pollen-chyle exist at all in either the
first or second stomach of the bee, whence alone it could be
regurgitated.&nbsp; Bee-milk, it would seem, is still a
physiological mystery, and so may remain to the end of time.</p>

209</span>CHAPTER XXX<br />
THE BEE-BURNERS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Country</span> wanderings towards the end
of summer, even now when the twentieth century is two decades
old, still bring to light many ancient and curious things.&nbsp;
Within an hour of London, and side by side with the latest
agricultural improvements, you can still see corn coming down to
the old reaping-hook, still watch the plough-team of bullocks
toiling over the hillside, still get that unholy whiff of sulphur
in the bee-gardens where the old-fashioned skeppists are
&ldquo;taking up&rdquo; their bees.</p>
<p>Burning-time came round usually towards the end of August,
sooner or later according to the turn of the season.&nbsp; The
bee-keeper went the round of his hives, choosing out the heaviest
and the lightest stocks.&nbsp; The heaviest hives were taken
because they contained most honey; the lightest because, being
short of stores, they were unlikely to survive the winter, and
had best be put to profit at once for what they were worth.&nbsp;
Thus a complete reversal of the doctrine of the survival of the
fittest was artificially brought about by the old
bee-masters.&nbsp; The most vigorous strains of bees were
carefully weeded out <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>year by year, and the perpetuation
of the race left to those stocks which had proved themselves
malingerers and half-hearts.</p>
<p>There was also another way in which this system worked wholly
for the bad.&nbsp; If a hive of bees reached burning-time with a
fully charged storehouse, it was probably due to the fact that
the stock had cast no swarm that year, and had, therefore,
preserved its whole force of workers for honey-getting.&nbsp;
Under the light of modern knowledge, any stall of bees that
showed a lessened tendency towards swarming would be carefully
set aside, and used as the mother-hive for future generations;
for this habit of swarming, necessary under the old dispensation,
is nothing else than a fatal drawback under the new.&nbsp; The
scientific bee-master of to-day, with his expanding
brood-chambers and his system of supplying his hives artificially
with young and prolific queens every third year, has no manner of
use for the old swarming-habit.&nbsp; It serves but to break up
and hopelessly to weaken his stocks just when he has got them to
prime working fettle.&nbsp; Although the honey-bee still clings
to this ancient impulse, there is no doubt that selective
cultivation will ultimately evolve a race of bees in which the
swarming-fever shall have been much abated, if not wholly
extinguished; and then the problem of cheap English honey will
have been solved.&nbsp; But in ancient times the bee-gardens were
replenished only from those hives wherein the swarming-fever was
most rampant.&nbsp; The old bee-keepers, in consigning all their
heavy stocks to the sulphur-pit, unconsciously did their best to
exterminate all non-swarming strains.</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>The
bee-burning took place about sunset, or as soon as the last
honey-seekers were home for the night.&nbsp; Small circular pits
were dug in some quiet corner hard by.&nbsp; These were about six
or eight inches deep, and a handful of old rags that had been
dipped in melted brimstone having been put in, the bee-keeper
went to fetch the first hive.&nbsp; The whole fell business went
through in a strange solemnity and quietude.&nbsp; A knife was
gently run round under the edge of the skep, to free it from its
stool, and the hive carefully lifted and carried, mouth
downwards, towards the sulphur-pit, none of the doomed bees being
any the wiser.&nbsp; Then the rag was ignited and the skep
lowered over the pit.&nbsp; An angry buzzing broke out as the
fumes reached the undermost bees in the cluster, but this quickly
died down into silence.&nbsp; In a minute or two every bee had
perished, and the pit was ready for the next hive.</p>
<p>That this senseless and wickedly wasteful custom should have
been almost universal among bee-men up to comparatively recent
times is sufficiently a matter for wonder; but that the practice
should still survive in certain country districts to-day
well-nigh passes belief.&nbsp; If the art of bee-driving&mdash;a
simple and easy method by which all the bees in a full hive may
be transferred unhurt to an empty one, and that within a few
minutes&mdash;were a new discovery, the thing might be condoned
as all of a piece with the general benightedness of
medi&aelig;val folk.&nbsp; But bee-driving was known, and openly
advocated, by several writers on apiculture at least a hundred
years ago.&nbsp; By this method, just as easy as the old and
cruel one, not only do the entire stores of each hive fall into
the undisputed <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>possession of the bee-master, but he retains the colony
of bees complete and unharmed for future service.&nbsp; He has
secured all the golden eggs, and the goose is still alive.</p>
<p>Those who desire to make a start in beemanship inexpensively
might do worse than adopt a practice which the writer has
followed for many years past.&nbsp; As soon as the time for the
bee-burners&rsquo; work arrives, a bicycle is rigged up with a
bamboo elongation fore and aft.&nbsp; From this depend a number
of straw skeps tied over with cheese-cloth.&nbsp; A bee-smoker
and a set of driving-irons complete the equipment, and there is
no more to do than sally forth into the country in search of
condemned bees.</p>
<p>It is usually not difficult to persuade the cottage apiarist
to let you operate on his hives.&nbsp; As soon as he learns that
all you ask for your trouble is the bees, while you undertake to
leave him the entire honey-crop and a <i>pour-boire</i> into the
bargain, he readily gives you access to his stalls.&nbsp; The
work before you is now surprisingly simple.&nbsp; A few strong
puffs of smoke into the entrance of the hive under manipulation
will effectually subdue the bees.&nbsp; Then the hive is lifted,
turned over, and placed mouth upwards in any convenient
receptacle&mdash;a pail or bucket will do, and will hold it as
firmly as need be.&nbsp; Your own travelling-gear now comes into
use.&nbsp; One of the empty skeps is fitted over the inverted
hive.&nbsp; The two are pinned together with an ordinary
meat-skewer at one point, and then the skep is prised up and
fixed on each side with the driving-irons, so that the whole
looks like a box with the lid half-raised.&nbsp; Now you have
merely to take up a position in front of the two hives, and <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>begin a
steady gentle thumping on the lower one with the palms of the
hands.</p>
<p>At first, as the combs begin to vibrate, nothing but chaos and
bewilderment are observable among the bees.&nbsp; For a moment or
two they run hither and thither in obvious confusion.&nbsp; But
presently they seem to get an inkling of what is required of
them, and then follows one of the most interesting, not to say
fascinating, sights in the whole domain of bee-craft.&nbsp;
Evidently the bees arrive at a common agreement that the
foundations of their old home have become, from some mysterious
cause or other, undermined and perilous; and the word goes forth
that the stronghold must be abandoned without more ado.&nbsp; On
what initiation the man&oelig;uvre is started has never been
properly ascertained; but in a little while an ordered discipline
seems to spread throughout the erstwhile distracted
multitude.&nbsp; In one solid hurrying phalanx the bees begin to
sweep up into the empty skep.&nbsp; Once fairly on the march, the
process is soon completed.&nbsp; In eight or ten minutes at most,
the entire colony hangs in a dense compact cluster from the roof
of your hive.&nbsp; Below, brood-combs and honey-combs are alike
entirely deserted.&nbsp; There is nothing left for you to do now
but carefully to detach the uppermost skep: replace the
cheese-cloth, thus securing your prisoners for their journey to
their new home; and to set about driving the next stock.</p>

EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN HIVE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bee-master, explaining to an
interested novice the wonders of the modern bar-frame hive, often
finds himself confronted by a very awkward question.&nbsp; He is
at no loss for words, so long as he confines himself to an
enumeration of the hive&rsquo;s many advantages over the ancient
straw skep&mdash;its elastic brood and honey chambers, its
movable combs interchangeable with all other hives in the garden,
its power of doubling and trebling both the number of worker-bees
in a colony and the amount of harvested honey; above all, its
control over sanitation and the breeding of unnecessary
drones.&nbsp; But when he is asked the question: Who invented
this hive which has brought about such a revolution in bee-craft?
his eloquence generally comes to a dead stop.&nbsp; Perhaps one
in a hundred of skilled modern bee-keepers is able to answer the
query.&nbsp; But the ninety-nine will tell you the bar-frame hive
had no single inventor; it came to its latter-day perfection by
little and little&mdash;the conglomerate result of years of
experience and the working of many minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>This
is, of course, as true of the modern bee-hive as it is of all
other appliances of world-wide utility.&nbsp; But it is equally
true that everything must have had a prime inception at some
time, and through some special human agency or other; and, in the
case of the bar-frame hive, the honours appear to be pretty
equally divided between two personages widely separated in the
world&rsquo;s history&mdash;Samson and Sir Christopher Wren.</p>
<p>Perhaps these two names have never before been bracketed
together either in or out of print; yet that the association is
not a fanciful, but in all respects a natural and necessary one
will not be difficult to prove.</p>
<p>The story of how Samson, albeit unconsciously, first gave the
idea of the movable comb-frame to an English bee-master is
probably new to most apiarians.&nbsp; As to whether the cloud of
insects which Samson saw about the carcase of the dead lion were
honey-bees or merely drone-flies, we need not here pause to
determine.&nbsp; We are concerned for the moment only with one
modern explanation of the incident.&nbsp; This is that, although
honey-bees abominate carrion in general, in this particular case
the carcase had been so dried and emptied and purified by the sun
and usual scavenging agencies of the desert as to leave nothing
but a shell&mdash;a very serviceable makeshift for a bee-hive, in
fact&mdash;consisting of the tanned skin stretched over the ribs
of the lion.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1834 a certain Major Munn was walking among
his hives, pondering the ancient Bible narrative, when a sudden
brilliant idea occurred to him.&nbsp; Like most advanced
bee-keepers <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>of his day, he had long grown dissatisfied with the
straw hive, and his bees were housed in square wooden
boxes.&nbsp; But these, although more lasting, were nearly as
unmanageable as the skeps.&nbsp; The bees built their combs
within them on just the same haphazard plan; and, once built, the
combs were fixed permanently to the tops of the boxes.&nbsp; Now,
the idea which had occurred to Major Munn was simply this: He
reflected that the combs built by the bees in the dry shell of
the lion-skin were probably attached each to one of the
encircling ribs; so that, when Samson took the honey-comb, all he
need have done was to remove a rib, bringing the attached comb
away with it.&nbsp; Thereupon Major Munn set to work to make a
hive on the rib-plan, which was composed of a number of wooden
frames standing side by side, each to contain a comb and each
removable at will.&nbsp; Since that time numberless small and
great improvements have been devised; but, in its essence, the
modern hive is no more than the dried lion-skin distended by the
ribs, as Samson found it on that day when he went on his fateful
mission of wooing.</p>
<p>The part played by Sir Christopher Wren in the evolution of
the bar-frame hive, though not so romantic, was fraught with
almost equal significance to modern bee-craft.&nbsp; Movable
comb-frames were as yet undreamed of in Wren&rsquo;s time, nearly
two hundred years before Major Munn invented them.&nbsp; But Wren
seems to have been the discoverer of a principle just as
important.&nbsp; This was what latter-day bee-keepers call
&ldquo;storification.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wren&rsquo;s hive consisted of
a series of wooden boxes, octagonal in shape, placed one below
the other, with <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>inter-communicating doors, and glass windows in the
sides of each section.&nbsp; Up to that date bee-hives had been
merely single receptacles made of straw, plastered wattles, or
wood.&nbsp; When the stock had outgrown its dwelling there was
nothing for it but to swarm.&nbsp; But by the device of adding
another story below the first one, when this was crowded with
bees, and a third or even a fourth if necessary, Wren was able to
make his hive grow with the growth of his bee-colony or contract
with its post-seasonal decline.&nbsp; He had, in fact, invented
the elastic brood-chamber, which alone enables the bee-master to
put in practice the one cardinal maxim of successful
bee-keeping&mdash;the production of strong stocks.</p>
<p>Wren&rsquo;s octagon storifying hive seems to have been
plagiarised by most eminent bee-masters of his day and after with
the na&iuml;ve dishonesty so characteristic among bee-men of the
time.&nbsp; Thorley&rsquo;s hive is obviously taken from, indeed,
is probably identical with, that of Wren.&nbsp; The hive made and
sold by Moses Rusden, King Charles II.&rsquo;s bee-master, is of
almost exactly the same pattern, but it is described as
manufactured under the patent of one John Geddie.&nbsp; This
patent was taken out by Geddie in 1675, and Geddie would appear
to be the arch-purloiner of the whole crew.&nbsp; For it is quite
certain that, having had one of Wren&rsquo;s hives shown to him,
he was not content with merely copying it, but actually went and
patented the principle as his own idea.</p>
<p>But Wren&rsquo;s hive, good as it was in comparison with the
single-chambered straw skep or wooden box, still lacked one vital
element.&nbsp; Although he <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>and his imitators had realised the
advantage of an expanding bee-hive, this was secured only by the
process of &ldquo;nadiring,&rdquo; or adding room below.&nbsp;
Thus the upper part of Wren&rsquo;s hive always contained the
oldest and dirtiest combs, and as bees almost invariably carry
their stores upwards, the production of clear, uncontaminated
honey under this system was impossible.&nbsp; It remained for a
Scotsman, Robert Kerr, of Stewarton, in Ayrshire, to perfect,
some hundred and fifty years later, what Wren had so ingeniously
begun.</p>
<p>Whether Kerr&mdash;or &ldquo;Bee Robin,&rdquo; as he was
called by his neighbours&mdash;ever saw or heard of hives on Sir
Christopher Wren&rsquo;s plan has never been ascertained.&nbsp;
But plagiarism was in the air throughout those far-off times, and
there is no reason to think Kerr better than his fellows.&nbsp;
In any case, the &ldquo;Stewarton&rdquo; hive, like Wren&rsquo;s,
was octagon in shape, and had several stories; but these stories
were added above as well as below.&nbsp; By placing his empty
boxes first underneath the original brood-chamber, to stimulate
increase of population, and then, when the honey-flow began,
placing more boxes above to receive the surplus honey, &ldquo;Bee
Robin&rdquo; succeeded in getting some wonderful harvests.&nbsp;
His big supers, full of snow-white virgin honey-comb, were soon
the talk of Glasgow, where he readily sold them.&nbsp; Imitators
sprang up far and near, and it is only within the last
twenty-five or thirty years that his hives can be said to have
fallen into desuetude.</p>
<p>But probably his success was due not more to his invention of
the expanding honey-chamber than to two other important
innovations which he effected <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>in bee-craft.&nbsp; The octagonal
boxes of Wren had fixed tops with a central hole, much like the
straw hive still used by the old-fashioned bee-keepers to this
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bee Robin&rdquo; did away with these fixed
tops, and substituted a number of parallel wooden bars from which
the combs were suspended, the spaces between the bars being
filled by slides withdrawable at will.&nbsp; He could thus, after
having added a story to his honey-chamber, allow the bees access
to it by withdrawing his slides from the outside: and when the
super was filled with honey-comb, the slides were again employed
in shutting off communication, whereupon the super could be
easily removed.</p>
<p>This, however, though it greatly facilitated the work of the
bee-master, did not account for the large yields of surplus
honey, which the &ldquo;Stewarton&rdquo; hive first made
possible.&nbsp; In the light of modern bee-knowledge, it is plain
that a big honey-harvest can only be secured by a corresponding
large stock of bees, and Robert Kerr seems to have been the
originator of what was nothing less than a revolution in the
craft.&nbsp; Hitherto the bee-keeper had estimated his wealth
according to the number of his hives, and the more these
subdivided by swarming, the more prosperous their owner accounted
himself.&nbsp; But &ldquo;Bee Robin&rdquo; reversed all
this.&nbsp; He housed his swarms not singly, but always two at a
time; and he made large stocks out of small ones by the simple
expedient of piling the brood-boxes of several colonies
together.&nbsp; In a word, it was the &ldquo;Dreadnought&rdquo;
principle applied to the peaceful traffic of the hives.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
